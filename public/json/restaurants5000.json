[{"date":"2016-06-19","rating":"5.0","review":"My new fave DTLA dinner spot!!I'm not a fan of German foods as they are usually pretty fatty and not that tasty (talking mostly about pubs here), but little did I know this restaurant is unlike all the rest!They specialize in different types of sausages! They even have categories from traditional flavors to exotic ones.There was a long line when we arrived and this was on a Wednesday night so be prepared for that. I'm not sure where everyone else parked but we found street parking about 10 minutes away. Still beats the $12 price tag for the parking lot nearby.This restaurant is mostly counter service. You order your sausages and some beers in the front and then when you go to the back you take a seat at either a small table or one of the long tables with benches! That's a neat touch. There is also a bar in the back where you can oder more drinks and fries.I ordered the chicken apple sausage and my husband ordered the rattlesnake! Both were delicious but I was more of a fan of the chicken apple because I always prefer things a little sweeter. We shared the pheasant sausage, which was okay. A little too spicy for me. You have a choice of toppings and I went with the caramelized onions and the sweet bell pepper, so good! When you order for a big group they give you a big platter of all the toppings so I tried a little of all the toppings but I was still happy with my 2 choices.Seriously can't wait to come back!!!"},{"date":"2016-06-18","rating":"3.0","review":"I've had this place bookmarked for ages but never managed to try it out until last year. I came here with my friend CW on a weekday evening and thankfully the line wasn't too long. Like most of the businesses in this area, Wurstkuche does not have their own parking so you have to find street parking in the area. We found a spot a couple blocks away and walked on over. You stand in line to order at the counter and then you find seating in the back area (they also have a patio as well). They have a large space in the back with plenty of spacing, thank goodness. The best part of this visit was that I found out how to pronounce the name! It's wurst-ku-keh!This place is known for their sausages, which come served on a freshly baked roll with your choice of two toppings (out of four). They have a large sausage menu - 6 classic choices, 7 gourmet choices, and 8 exotic choices. I decided to go with the \"gourmet\" choice of Sun Dried Tomato & Mozzarella, with chicken and turkey meat. I got it with Caramelized Onions and Sauerkraut. You can help yourself to as much ketchup and mustard (five kinds) as you want in the back as they are self-serve. The sausage was decent but the sauerkraut was meh and overall I was not as impressed with the sausage as I had hoped I would be.They also offer Belgian Fries, which are double dipped and served with your choice of sauces. You can get the Klein, which is their small and comes with one dipping sauce, or the Groot, which is large and comes with two dipping sauces. They have 10 dipping sauces total and if you want additional ones it will be $0.75 each. I do not remember which dipping sauces we got but we got the Groot because (1) I love that name bc of Guardians of the Galaxy and (2) we were sharing so of course we needed the larger size. I love fries so of course these were great! Can't go wrong with getting the fries here.The ambience, setting, service, and fries here were all great. Even the bathroom is pretty nice! But I was not impressed with my sausage, so I probably won't come back... unless I'm in the area and craving their fries ;)"},{"date":"2016-06-18","rating":"5.0","review":"I DONT EVEN LIKE HOTDOGS, but I was starving so I had one.... AMAZING. Got the Classic Bratfurst with caramelized onion and sweet peppers. The sauces (6) they provide on the side were delicious, so I added some of that every bite or so. The fries were also delicious. Would recommend getting both :) Ambience was great as well. Good music (DJ was there), Dim lighting, and paper covered tables with crayons to draw on them. Oh, and fast service!"},{"date":"2016-06-15","rating":"5.0","review":"If you are a big fan of sausages, this is the place for you. Man that sounds bad but it's true.  They have a wide variety of meats that will make any hungry patron go completely crazy. For example, myself. I am visiting from out of town and I had literally just gotten out from LAX. I tell my companions that we need to eat here. And so we do. Like any place that serves sausages, they have their  basics. Bratwurst (my fav), hot link, etc. what I do love the most is that they create sausages using different meats. Now call me naive, but I've never had different types of meat in sausage form. They had duck which is a delight and rabbit which I have yet to try. Ladies and gentlemen, this place is a must if you're in LA. BEER, food and a great interior atmosphere. It can get a bit loud in there but who's really paying attention? Enjoy and eat up!!"},{"date":"2016-06-04","rating":"4.0","review":"Fun place to hang out while enjoying tasty hot dogs and sipping on some delicious beer!I always end up visiting this place whenever I'm in the Arts District of LA!

Personally, I've had better sausages, but definitely come here to try the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage just to say you've eaten those animals. (just realized vegetarians probably hate me now for writing that...) The sausages were a little bland, but maybe it's the meat? Or it could be seasoned more? Also, what's fun about this place is they provide crayons where you can doodle on the butcher-paper placemats!"},{"date":"2016-06-13","rating":"4.0","review":"Not your typic hot dog joint .. I remember when this place opened all my Central Division friends were blowing this place up. Great dogs , good beer selection ( for of duty drinking of course) and great fries ! I always remember a line when I come here , and during the day you probably don't have to wait for a table.So this particular Saturday night , I was meeting up with some friends in the Arts district. I've been training  a lot lately for desert racing and decided I'd stop in for a bite and beers before the venue. It was spot on with hipsters , a line and standing room only.I decided to vegetarian dog with carmelized onions and sweet peppers - with a side of fries. I grabbed my number and steered toward the music. Standing room only and a Dj bumpin the groove I headed toward the bar . I was lucky enough to get the only open seat ! I ordered a brew and begin to unwind. It was a bit noisy with the music , and people trying to talk but calm - compared to my 450 screaming in the desert.My food came about 15 minutes later , when I was conversing with a couple of youngster first timers . The fries caught their attention , and I had gotten the peanut dip sauce ( a first time for me). I relaxed with another beer as I watched the fries disappear .As I departed I made a note on the next visit  I'm gonna try an exotic and get a large order of fries . One thing I remember seeing is they offered beer flights , a definite must try. So all in all 4 stars .Just a note to Nikki , one of the youngsters who was stealing my fries. You had the pretties blue eyes I've seen in a long time , see you on Yelp ."},{"date":"2016-06-15","rating":"3.0","review":"So what does everyone get here that theres always a crazy line?!We went here for the first time...i have to say, the atmosphere is sweet. Super hipster, young, relazed vibe. Thankfully we arrived just in time to miss the long line and grab a seat at the bar.I ordered a Bitburger which was great. I also ordered a link which I can't recall the name with grilled onions and  sauerkraut. Good...but not amazing.

After eating here a million times, it's about time for a review. I've been eating here since it first opened, but it's still a place I'll go every so often. I love the range of different sausages they have, the different sauces, the beers, and best of all, the fries.Everything goes so well together. The sausages have such a nice bite to them, both in spiciness and in texture from the casing. Get the caramelized onions and spicy peppers on top of your sausages. Get the truffle oil on your fries.Try every sauce they have. Try the bleu cheese with walnut & bacon. And the Chipotle aoili. If you're feeling adventurous, try the ketchup.

Wasn't really digging the waiting in line to order and then having to look for a place to sit. It was pretty busy but we were able to find a table pretty quickly. They have pretty good beer. I was pretty excited to try the different types of hot dogs. Between 2 of us we had 3 hot dogs. Here's a break down of the food: Rattlesnake dog: 4 STARS honestly, it doesn't taste much different than other ones. it had some sort of spicy level Veggie: 5 STARS really glad I got thisChicken Mango: 5 STARS Delicious, I was so stuffed by the time we ate this onethe most delicious part of our meal was probably all the sauces they offer BUT they are not free."},{"date":"2016-04-30","rating":"4.0","review":"Hefeweizens + grilled sausage and fries + DJ = awesome spot!----------------------We've been to this place a few times. This is at a very unique corner between little Tokyo and downtown / skid row. This has definitely become a hipster part of town, with apartments, umami burger, eighty two barcade, etc. The food here is pretty awesome. The Filipino maharlica (spelling) is good, reminds me of Chinese sweet sausage. Thick cut steak fries are crisped just right. Their mustard selections at table side are pretty bomb. Plus, they have butcher paper on the tables, so feel free to doodle while you wait. The best part? Their beer selection. I'm a huge Hef fan (beer and person), and they serve insane liter beers (like in German Biergartens). Good times were had by all. So come early, come often. Just be ready for the lines. And parking may be an issue, gotta pay for valet more often than not (unless you're willing to find street parking a few blocks away in the sketchier parts)"},{"date":"2016-06-03","rating":"4.0","review":"I really like the sausages here - not too overwhelming.  I opted to keep it basic with the chicken apple sausage and really enjoyed it with sweet peppers and sauerkraut on top.  I found I didn't even need to add ketchup or mustard (and they have a variety of mustards you can add).  Love the fries - crispy and big steak-like Belgian fries.  Great variety of beer too - I had the strawberry beer - initially really liked it but after drinking it halfway, I did start feeling like it had somewhat of a \"fake\" strawberry taste to it.  Can't go wrong with a combo of german sausage and beer!"},{"date":"2016-06-10","rating":"4.0","review":"Couldn't decide on one type so ordered 5.

I think they're in the top 5 places in the world with the most Yelp reviews, and rightfully so! They're running the operations like a top & the food is on point. Be prepared to wait a bit, but it's worth it!When you walk in, a staffmember hands you a menu as you wait in line to order your food. He was taking drink orders for people that wanted a beer while waiting in line to order at the counter. Sara & I shared the original bratwurst with sweet peppers & onions, and a large fries with chipotle aioli & pesto mayo. Yum! For $16, it wasn't bad to share... would have been a lot of food for one person but good to share with another. They have several beers on tap + wines (no liquor).For a damn good German bratwurst, be sure to check out Wurstkuche when you're in DTLA... unless the line is killer long, you won't be disappointed :)"},{"date":"2016-05-05","rating":"5.0","review":"Usually sausages would not be my go to entre; however on the recommendation of a friend, I brought my partner-in-dine here last weekend for a date night. Do not be afraid of the line, the friendliest, most accommodating host guides you quickly through the line, the menu, and even brings you a beer of your choice to enjoy while you wait to order from their extensive case of in house made sausages. The beer menu is an array of elusive craft beers, which you can sample away to find the right fit for your palette and your meal. The sausages vary from the milder choices such as Kielbasa to intricate pairings such as duck, bacon, and jalapeno. You may choose two toppings, and it is served on a home made bun. SOOOOOO GOOOD!Our choices:-Keilbasa with caramelized onions and spicy peppers-Duck, bacon and jalapeno with sauerkrat-Double dipped fries are a MUST! You may choose two sauces. We ordered Curry Ketchup and Chipotle Aioli.Beyond the exceptional food, the atmosphere also won me over. You seat yourself either at a small table or you can mingle with others at long picnic tables. However we chose the bar (it was all that was open!), which was great for easy access to sampling more beers. Three cheers for Wurstkuche!P.s. They have a bathroom. Parking is terrible."},{"date":"2016-05-04","rating":"5.0","review":"Usually I wouldn't be the person to want to eat a hotdog. (It's so basic.) But I decided to stop by Wurstkuche because they have such an interesting exotic variety of sausages and meats. The parking sucks. Unless you can find street parking, be expected to pay around $7-$10 at marked lots. Came in around lunch time, there was a bit of a line but nothing too bad. You order your food at the register and they hand you a number and you go inside the restaurant where there are a plethora of tables to sit at. One thing I really also appreciated about Wurstkuche was they have 5 different mustards for you to use on your hotdog! Talk about variety! I had the Rattlesnake and Rabbit Hot dog and it was so delicious! Defiantly not your ordinary basic hotdog. It was so flavorful, I kept eating it fast and regretting it because it was still pretty hot but I couldn't help to just chow it down. If you're in arts district I strongly suggest this place! Also they have an incredible selection of beers! A great place to kick it with your date or friends."},{"date":"2016-06-17","rating":"5.0","review":"Definitely a spot to try if like hot dogs & sausages!Came here on Tuesday with a friend, there was a long line, but we probably waited 10-15 minutes to order first and then we headed to the back (they also have an outside dining area.) They have condiments all throughout their dining area (Ketchup, Mustard, Honey Mustard, etc.). You can order 2 toppings to go with your sausages - caramelized onions, sweet peppers, sauerkraut, and spicy peppers.Their beer menu is pretty good! I loved their Floris Apple Ale - it was REALLY sweet and refreshing. My friend ordered 2 Chimays, which I think he thoroughly enjoyed. **Tip: They also have a bar in the back dining area.My friend and I shared the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers & White Truffle Oil Glaze Fries w/ Chipotle Aioli & Ranch. I also ordered the Kielbasa, and my friend had the Louisiana Hot Link. This was A LOT of food. I loved everything!!

So many delicious options to choose from. Hoping to try them all at one point or another.+ To date, I've had the Louisiana Hot Link, Kielbasa and Hot Italian. All equally delicious and flavorful. Get the sweet onion and peppers and pair with fries. Don't forget the chipotle aioli or pesto mayo. Pair with whatever bier is recommended.+ Staff has always been accommodating, friendly and prompt. They got you every time.+ Get in line, grab a drink, place your order and take a seat inside or outside. Inside is loud, lively and communal, while outside is more local and chill. Both are great options to enjoy depending on your mood.+ There is a bar inside if you just want one of their many artisanal biers on draft.+ DJ on site some days, spinning good things.+ Dessert at Pie Hole, anyone? Major bonus points.Cons:- Parking is hideous. If all else fails and you get tired or run out of gas from making the rounds, settle for one of the lots at your discretion. Use them as an absolute last resort.- There is almost always a line for dinner on weekends, maybe even weekdays. There will be a wait of 25+ minutes."},{"date":"2016-05-24","rating":"5.0","review":"I love Wurstkuche! I love everything about this place. From the décor, ambience, food to the concept, I love it all! Its nestled in the cute arts district, so perfect place to grab lunch, drinks, dinner, and then you can grab coffee (Groundwork) or dessert (Pie Hole) literally walking distance! The place can get a bit busy and loud at nights and weekends, but its all a part of the experience! Highlights: - Rattlesnake: For those that have never been here, I know this may sound a bit \"out there\", but its really not. Think about what you are eating when you are eating a sausage...just ground up meat, which is exactly what they do when they incorporate the rattlesnake and its delicious! It doesn't taste that different from a typical sausage you would try elsewhere, just slightly more flavorful, so I would definitely recommend this hot dog! If you are contemplating between the alligator and the rattlesnake, I highly recommend the rattlesnake!- Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle: Yum! I was recommended this sausage for vegetarians that like spicy! Its not that spicy, but very flavorful and simply delicious! - French Fries: MUST GET THE FRIES and the dipping sauces! The French fries here are just delicious and their dipping sauces pair perfectly with everything. My personal favorite sauces are: Pesto Mayo / Sundried Tomato Aioli / Chipotle Aioli*Only downfall to this place is the parking, but I have always managed to find parking with some patience!"},{"date":"2016-06-17","rating":"5.0","review":"Rattlesnake and rabbit sausage is a surprisingly amazing item.

Super relaxed and cute atmosphere within the restaurant and its surrounding areas. There is plenty of seating inside and outside. What we ordered:Mango Jalapeno - (toppings: caramelized onions and spicy peppers) This has a sweet taste to it but with a slight kick of spices. I totally recommend this for people who are looking to try something different but still want to stay in that comfort zone. The spicy peppers were not spicy at all and the sweetness from the caramelized onions went well with the hot dog.Kielbasa - (toppings: caramelized onions and sweet peppers) I feel like you can't go wrong with getting the Kielbasa, it was pretty basic. There wasn't really a unique taste to it but it was still good. I think the toppings really added to it and enhanced the hot dog.Groot - (sauce: curry ketchup and chipotle aioli) These are thick cut Belgium fries. They were fried to perfection, crispy on the outside and a nice soft texture on the inside. The curry ketchup was really good and had a nice consistency to it. The chipotle aioli was just alright, it didn't have much flavor to it, just really creamy. The only bad thing I have to say about Wurstkuche was that I did not like the rolls the hot dogs were served in. Way to much bread that was on the chewy side and I feel like it was not toasted enough.The server at the front also recommended some good beers and allowed us to sample them before we committed to a whole drink. Super friendly and thoughtful."},{"date":"2016-02-25","rating":"4.0","review":"Feeling peckish? Head to Wurstkuche in LA's Arts District, grab a sausage, Belgian fries and a pint of craft beer and you'll lose that feeling in no time!We were so hungry after spending half a day at the beach, so we stopped by Wurstkuche on our way home. For me its location is perfect as The Pie Hole is across the street. You can easily grab dessert there after lunch at Wurstkuche.I was looking forward to trying their Filipino Maharlika Sausage, but unfortunately they were out of them! Darn! I ended up getting one of the Exotics--the Duck and Bacon--and the hubby settled on one of their more traditional sausages, the Kielbasa. We weren't feeling adventurous that day, so we passed on the Rattlesnake and Rabbit sausages. The Duck and Bacon was good. It was juicy and tasty, especially with caramelized onions and peppers on top. My husband liked the Kielbasa a lot. He loves sausages and felt that this one had good flavor. We were both happy to find that the sausages weren't too salty, as some sausages can be. We also thought the size was pretty good. Not too big. With a small Belgian fries to share, and a sausage each, we were definitely full at the end.You have to get the Belgian fries here! Best I've had in a while and I normally don't like thicker cut fries. They were so crunchy and nicely seasoned. We just ordered it plain, but you can order it with truffle oil too. We chose the Chipotle Aioli as our dip of choice as suggested by many Yelpers, and loved it with the fries. They should bottle that Chipotle Aioli and sell it to the general public! So good!As for drinks, they have a nice selection of artisanal sodas and craft beer. I had the Elderflower Soda and really liked it.This is a casual place, so you order at the cashier and they deliver your meal to your table. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, and as it was close to 90 degrees that day, their outdoor section was full.  Even though all their sausages and condiments are made in house, their prices are very reasonable.  Lunch or dinner here will not break the bank.  2 sausages, 1 order of fries, and 1 drink cost about $24. We will definitely be back next time we're in LA! Hope they'll have the Maharlika sausage next time!"},{"date":"2016-02-23","rating":"5.0","review":"Allow me a moment to be overdramatic a bit on how it feels not to have a place like Wurstkuche in the Bay Area - it's basically tragic. Ever since my most recent visit here, I've had bouts of cravings for more... The only problem is that this place is located 5-6 hours away from where I reside. First world problems, I know. But that's how good this place is! The menu is simple in terms of choices, but also unique by the selection of sausages that are offered. Rabbit and rattlesnake sausage.. Hm... Perfect for adventurous souls like me.. who mooched off of the even braver soul who actually got it. I went with a more familiar, but still sort of adventurous choice - duck and bacon sausage. You pick your sausage, then your sauces (if dining there, sauces are available at the tables), and toppings. And it all comes in a hotdog bun.THEN, you pick your German beer, not included in price, to go with your hot dog (highly recommend having a beer with your hotdog if you're of age and like beer, just sayin') They sausages were super flavorful and we found that we didnt need to add any of the sauces to it at all. Since neither of us were knowledgeable with German beers nor do we speak/read German, it was a completely blind pick and luckily, both were delicious! Hrm.. Where do I get a Weizen-Eisbock around here... What is a Weizen-Eisbock...There are both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is really nice on a nice day, and especially perfect during a sunset. Sometimes we just need to take a moment and enjoy nature's beauty while sipping on a nice, cold beer!

They definitely have a great selection of beers, and the food isn't bad. It's a neat ambiance as well, and it's one of my go-to places to take visitors for a casual dinner before hitting the arts district scene. It's also right across the arts district brewery so that's pretty convenient if you want to fuel up on food before getting cray cray with the libations.The sausages are hit or miss. Sometimes they're really flavorful and a gastronomic exprience, but sometimes they're just meat. Like the rabbit sausage. Nothing special, tasted like any other sausage. You know what I mean. Overall, a constant on my list of local sausage joints!"},{"date":"2016-02-18","rating":"5.0","review":"I've been here on several occasions now. I came here again last night with several friends around 8p.m.. The lines were long, but not too bad. The staff were very attentive while we waited to order and suggested to us what's popular and offered to get in the drink orders. I ordered the:Mango Jalapeno with caramelized onions and sweet peppers ($6.50): Delicious gourmet sausage. I was starving when I had this so I engulfed it before I could see if it tasted much like mango. It's also not very spicy.White Truffle Oil Glaze Fries Size Klein ($5.50): My BF loves these fries and thinks it's the best thing ever. I think these are good, but not great. If they were a bit thinner, I'd like them a lot more. I ordered this with Curry Ketchup and the sauce was a bit hit. Another great sauce is their pesto mayo and famous chipotle aioli.Service: Great service and great staff. Very attentive and informative.Price: Pretty decent price especially for an eatery in DTLA! Sausages range from $6 - $8Parking: Circle around and you're bound to find something on the streets. There are plenty of meter parking free after 4 p.m.!Venue: My first visit here, I entered thinking it was an extremely small place. Later I realized that around back there is a larger seating area for the maximum capacity of 202 people. The seating style is \"German\" I assume where there are huge picnic tables all around!

What a cool spot in the middle of nowhere. Or atleast no where to me since I would've never found this spot without my coworker who just happens to have grown up around the area. First impression:  service is super friendly! They greet you as you enter, give you suggestions on what to order and overall very approachable. Sadly, I hear there's a huge buzz around the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage but I just wasn't brave enough. I ended up trying the mango jalapeño with caramelized onions and spicy peppers as my side along with some truffled fries with their blue cheese, walnut and bacon dip. YOU MUST TRY THIS DIP!!! The sausage was ok, I probably would have preferred something more savory since this sausage was on the sweeter side but overall very tasty. Price was reasonable, $8 for a sausage and $6 for large fries plus extra for the dips you choose and if you want truffle oil on the fries. If I'm in the area I'll probably be back but next time I'm gonna choose their lamb and herbs sausage :)"},{"date":"2016-02-14","rating":"5.0","review":"Cool little place in LA.

Sure the lines can be a little long in the evening time, but with good company it actually goes by pretty quick (~30 minutes).  Everything off the menu is great here, but my go to sausages are the rattlesnake & rabbit with jalapeño peppers or the rabbit & pork with leeks & carrots. The fries with truffle oil and honey mustard sauce (they have them on the benches for free) are also bomb dot com and I highly recommend them.Other than that the only gripe I have for this place is the parking, but since it's in LA, it's kind of expected that parking sucks."},{"date":"2016-01-27","rating":"5.0","review":"Since I wrote my review in 2011, I have been back to Wurstkuche a dozen+ times and it never disappoints.

I loved all the sausages but if I had to pick one that I'd order again, it'd be the Bratwurst. Simple & super flavorful. Everything is a little on the saltier side but nothing a little La Chouffe (golden ale 8% ABV 250 ml) can't solve.

If you're lucky, they'll serve a sample to their patiently waiting guests. This certainly helps to expedite things in a customer-friendly way. They've got a wide selection of beers to satisfy any beer aficionado (or not).My sample: The mango jalapeño was a subtly sweet wiener with a kick. I don't normally like mangos but this one's a winner.I ended up getting the chicken apple spice with caramelized onions (peppers give me acid reflux) and a large side of fries. My dog was a bit sweeter than I thought, especially with the onions, but overall was good. My boo got the bratwurst which was deeelicious. Their fries are large, well-seasoned and come with a choice of 2 sauces. The tzatziki sauce is quite light and adds a subtle cream flavor to the fries. My pick would be the chipotle aioli- yummy!

I had no idea there were so many different kinds of sausages. My friend and I ordered the two most famous sausages on the menu. Pretty darn pricey too for sausage. After ordering we head over to the back of the restaurant and see cafeteria style seating.  Food came out pretty quickly. I was not impressed.

My fave was the chipotle aioli! These fries are no joke. They're crispy and thick cut fries! My BF and I immediately became big fans of their fries. - An Exotic sausage \"Lamb with mediterranean spices (x2)\" ($8) w/ caramelized onions and sweet peppers for myself. This choice came with not one but TWO sausages in between the bun. Only because the sausage was so thin compared to the other options. Anyways, I loved every bite of it! It was moist and super flavorful. It was cooked perfectly. - A Classic sausage \"Bockwurst\" ($6) w/ caramelized onions and sweet pepper for my BF. My BF enjoyed it a lot. But I wasn't a huge fan of it. -I washed down my food with a belgian beer, the La Chouffe ($8). It is a golden ale, which paired very well with the food.

However, I think this place is worth that struggle.The way this place works is you order at the cashier and they give you a number. Then you seat yourself and they bring you your food. I've been here twice and both times the line was out the door. However, it moves fairly fast. They have someone monitoring the line to see if you have any questions. They'll also get your drink order so you can sip on something while you wait, which is nice.This place is known for super exotic sausages like rattlesnake and rabbit. I'm not that much of an adventurer, so I opted for less exotic choices. I've tried the Chicken Apple & Spices, which comes with 2 sausages. I've also tried the Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers, which has a kick to it. Both of these were pretty good! Also all hot dogs come with a choice of 2 toppings. I always opt for the caramelized onions and sweet peppers.They also have some pretty good fries. I usually get a few orders with my friends and pick different sauces so we can have a variety. My favorite is the chipotle aioli!They have a pretty good drink menu with a variety of beers. My go-to is the Fruli which is a strawberry beer. It's super yummy and doesn't taste like beer at all, which is perfect for the girly-girl in me.The seating area has a bunch of long picnic tables. And the times I've been here, they have a DJ spinning some sick tunes. Definitely a cool place to come with friends or on a casual date.

I appreciate their incredibly clever and outright wicked combinations (rattlesnake + rabbit?! pheasant?!) but I found them to be a little small and inside a bun that just muted the flavors of the meat. Almost never do I say that a restaurant in San Diego is better than one in big city L.A., but Wurstkuche is not as good as Scott Slater's S&M Sausage and Meat eatery 120 miles south where the sausages are bigger, the bread is better and the meat is juicier.Still, I love the concept of Wurstkuche with its meat counter, craft beers on tap, sausages priced $6-$8, and beautifully hipster dimly lit dining room, so I will be back....especially for those fries."},{"date":"2016-06-16","rating":"4.0","review":"Myself and two girlfriends decided to meet here for food and girl talk.

When it came down to placing my order, the guy at the register was approachable and made me feel comfortable at the fact I had no clue what to order. I finally ordered the vegetarian Apple sage with onions and sweet peppers. Luckily the three of us were able to find seats after ordering. Everything was great from the beer to the food, and ambiance. Here is where I had an issue. Two of us went to the bar to get another drink. There was a male and a female with dark long curly hair. I meant to get her name(thought about taking her picture, but I'm not that petty) My friend and I had been standing at the bar for about 5 minutes with no eye contact or greeting made. The male bartender made his way to the other end leaving the girl with curly hair at the other end where we were standing. Two males had approached the bar after us, and she immediately greeted them and took their order. I was blown away. My first thought was to go get a drink at the front, however there was a long line.

I came with a friend on a Sunday evening, only to be greeted by a monstrous line that went out the door, but it ended up moving pretty quickly so we only waited maybe 20 minutes or so. We decided to split the Sun Dried Tomato & Mozzarella and the Chicken Apple, just for some variety, as well as a large order of fries. Man, oh man, I was NOT disappointed! Of the two sausages, I think I liked the Sun Dried Tomato one better, just because it had more of a flavorful kick to it, whereas the Chicken Apple was a little more tame, but still very good. The fries though...THE FRIES. The girl who was directing the line recommended that we get the Chipotle Aioli and the BBQ and to double dip the sauces, and she definitely hit the nail on the head with that one. Even without the sauces, the fries were still deep, deep fried to perfection.The seating area has a really cool ambience to it. You can choose from smaller tables for more privacy, or longer picnic-style tables covered in paper and crayons if you're with a bigger group or just feel like reverting back to your childhood self! There's also a bar where you can order drinks and sit at for a more intimate setting. The place is dim and definitely very casual, making for a fun but low-key place to chill with some friends.I didn't try any of their beers this time...I know, I know, how could I?!

It looks closed off, but you go around the hallway to where seating is.  There's ample amount of seating space and ALL YOUR MUSTARD selections are on almost every table.  I really like how they have so many options for mustard. I think there were six different bottles. Anyway, it does take a while for food to arrive.  I ordered the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage (under the exotic meat section) with caramelized onions and spicy peppers.  The price for just this including tax is $8.72.  I think it's a bit overpriced for something so small, and it wasn't that filling either.  They have other things under the exotic meat section like duck and lamb (I personally don't consider those exotic though).  It was delicious, but I couldn't really tell if the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage really tasted any different than any other meat.  So, I wasn't too wow-ed.  Still pretty cool to say that I have eaten/tried rattlesnake/rabbit.  If you really wanted to eat rattlesnake or rabbit for what they really are and see how they really really really taste like, go to an Asian restaurant or something. Now I'm wondering if those restaurants exist in America.

When I found out about Wurstkuche, I knew I had to try them out. I headed over with some folks for dinner one night to see how good their sausages really were.They have a pretty large variety of sausages and have them on display up front. Even though I knew I wanted exotic meats, I still had a hard time deciding. I finally went with Duck and Bacon with Jalapenos, Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapenos, and Pheasant. All came served on a bun with peppers and onions. All 3 sausages were delicious, served fresh and piping hot, and each one had a unique flavor profile that tickled my taste buds. The Duck & Bacon was my favorite, but I could easily order any of them again, even though I would love to try some of the other flavors, too. We also ordered Belgian fries Groot (2 dipping sauces), and they were some of the best fries I have had in a while. The Blue Cheese Walnut and Bacon dipping sauce in particular is very tasty and is a sauce I definitely want to order again.The restaurant itself is very casual in the sense that you line up to order, take a number and find a table. The restaurant was quite crowded on a Wednesday evening, and the later it got the busier it became. They also have a very good draught beer list, primarily focusing on Belgian and German varieties. The prices seemed pretty reasonable, and the food was very good. If you like sausage, then you should check out Wurstkuche. You won't be disappointed."},{"date":"2016-05-13","rating":"5.0","review":"Neat place situated on a weird corner property that offers some bomb ass fries and different types of weiners! I ordered the Kielbasa with caramelized onions and spicy peppers. So good & totally worth the price. Everyone there was friendly and they really organize the line when you walk it so that it's not all chaotic with people standing everywhere (cause their ordering room is not very big). I definitely like their eating room; its very inviting and offers ample enough of seating, including the outdoor patio along the sidewalk. They also have complementary water.

I can't really say much about this place since I haven't had much of an experience. Dim lit, modern, sleek and minimal. Laurie P and I walked in through the front passing a refrigerator filled with at least 12 different types of uncooked sausages. Since we weren't there to eat, we went straight to the back, to the bar. Our bartender was a lovely young woman, very helpful and friendly in helping me find a beer. She offered me samples before I made my choice. I don't read zee German words and butchered the name of my beer. Lucky for me, I just pointed and said \"that one!\"The area it is in looked rather industrial. We found parking on the street, but I saw there's a private lot near by.The staff was friendly.

Can be rowdy. Bring a friend or a group. Best time to come on a weekend to avoid any wait or line is around 11:30am, just before noon because shortly after, the line does get long. Don't fret if you do see a line going outside as you drive by because the counter where you order is small and close to the door so there will always be people waiting outside.In a nutshell, all brats comes with 2 toppings of your choice: caramelized onions, sweet or spicy peppers, or sauerkraut. Basic bratty's for $6, premium for $7, and exotic for $8.I got the premium brat with caramelized onions and sauerkraut.  He got the rabbit and pork with sweet pepper and sauerkraut for $8.  We also got a side of their large fries for $6.  You can also order their raw links to go for 30% off.After you order and get your number, you walk to the back, past the restrooms, and you'll find a huge seating area, including a bar and patio outside for those who wish bring their dogs.  Every table has a set of condiments-- ketchup and different kinds of mustards.

We came here on a Friday night, when we walked up there was a line. We waited about 30-40 minutes. Once inside they start taking your drink order, so you can drink before you order. This place has a variety of sausages, even a few vegetarian options. You can order your sausage with or without a baked roll and add peppers and sweet onions. We each ordered vegetarian sausages, smoked apple sage and Mexican chipotle. We also ordered belgian fries. The smoked apple sage topped with peppers and sweet onions was savory. I would definitely try a meat option next time. Fries were good. This place was huge, a communial table setting, unless you find a table just for your group.

I've tried a bunch of the exotics, which are yummy, but I stick to the hot italian (which is spicier than the Austin Blues btw) with sweet peppers and caramelized onions. Try their fries! Thick cut and come out piping hot - $2 extra for truffle oil which TOTALLY makes a difference!You can order a beer while you're waiting in line, but there's also a bar in the eating area. Order your food, get a number, pick a seat and wait for the deliciousness to come to you. Indoor and outdoor seating available, outdoor seating is doggie friendly!

I liked the bun, which was nicely toasted and better than just your average. I couldn't finish the apple sage though... I wanted to experiment with something different (which I recommend!), but I ended up not liking it. Of course, it doesn't and shouldn't taste like meat, but it was missing the savory note and had an unappetizing flavor. The ginger beer is gooooood (non-alcoholic) [expensive]- like a soda with a ginger kick.They have a lot of long picnic tables - it's chill but can be a little dark if you go at night. Perhaps it might be better for a date.  I might give it a 3.5 for the taste of the mango jalapeño, but overall, the hot dogs are not satisfying/delicious enough to make me want to pay $8-$9 per dog.  If you're feeling adventurous and want to try some unique meats like lamb and rattle snake sausages, you might want to try this place out."},{"date":"2016-03-07","rating":"4.0","review":"Not a big fan of hotdogs but this place was pretty good and also a pretty interesting spot to hit up.

This place consistently has lines out the door but the lines usually go by pretty quickly. Once you enter the restaurant, you see a display of sausages in the window. All have a label on it that clearly describe all of the ingredients inside of the dog. They have everything you could possibly imagine - vegetarian options, exotic options (rattlesnake and rabbit, duck and bacon, pheasant with herbs, etc.) and your traditional hot dogs such as Louisiana hot links, Italian, etc. And you can sip on a nice cold Belgium beer while you wait too. After you place your order, you take your number and step into their back dining room area where they have another bar and plenty of spots to sit. I like how although this place is still very casual, they bring your food to the table and check to see if you need anything else. FOOD:I've tried a few of their sausages but I always go back to their duck and bacon. I get mine topped with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. The flavors are packed! Very savory and I like how there is a nice snap when you bite into the hot dog. They also have an array of mustards you can put on top of your dog. I am crazy for their spicy mustard which is slightly spicy but won't over power the actual flavors of the dog. Trust me, go with the duck and bacon. You will not regret it!And of course, you must get an order of their famous fries with truffle oil. Yes, get it with the truffle oil. You have to! For a large, you get only two options for sauces. They have so many unique flavors you will have a hard time to pick. I really liked their chipotle aioli and blue cheese with walnut and bacon. These fries have the perfect texture since they are double fried.   They seriously hit the spot every single freaking time. I think a large order is perfect for two people to share. Especially if you are a french fry fanatic like me, it will be easy to kill.PARKING:Can be rather tricky. Overall, if you love fries, beer, and hot dogs, Wurstuche will be your spot.

I usually get sick of things like that after half but this one I devoured the entire thing. I also tried my friends duck jalapeño one and that one was also really good but more on the heavier side. The place is self seating and you order your food in the front first and the servers bring it to you. I can't tell if I love or hate their fries.

For those of you who don't drink, or aren't legally allowed to, they have some of the best fries and some very unique sausages. From regular bratwurst to exotic rattlesnake and alligators, there's a fairly diverse selection of sausages to choose from. Whatever you choose though, please get a side of fries, they're delicious and only made more delicious by their selection of dipping sauces. Don't forget about their other sauces used for sausages!In case you haven't entered Wurstküche's interior yet, the front is pretty small where you order, but you can order a drink while you wait in line!

The sauerkraut was a little sour as expected which overpowered the taste of the caramelized onions. The Keilbasa sausage itself had plenty of taste to it which tasted really great. Oh and btw after you order, you walk through the long hallway and make it to this big room with rows of long benches. Made it feel like I was eating in a cafeteria in elementary school or something and tables on the side as well but they were all full which forced us to sit in the benches.

I don't even know where to begin. I've been coming to this location since 2012 with my culinary buddies as LATTC is somewhat close by! It was our lunch spot, crazy as it sounds since we're all chefs and we literally learn/work in kitchens! But Wurskuche is the place to be when you need that sausage and drink FIX! I will say this..if you eat MEAT, then GROW UP and try the EXOTICS! My TOP 3 Meat:-DUCK with bacon-Rabbit and Pork-Rattlesnake and RabbitThe best VEGETARIAN sausage for me would have to be the V. Smoked Apple Sage. The sausages are always cooked to order and oh so fresh and juicy in every bite! I always put the caramelized onions and sauerkraut for toppings. You can also choose from spicy peppers and sweet peppers. (peppers=BELLPEPPERS)I've never had their beers but instead, my go-to is the Manhattan Special Sarsaparilla! It's a bit sweet so I typically water it down. They have the BOX WATER or free water--CUCUMBER WATER--so delicious and refreshing. The Sarsaparilla tastes exactly like the Filipino RC soda or Sarsi! MUSTARDS GALORE! I used to not be into mustards but I learned to like it. I don't put a whole lot but when I eat it, I like the HONEY MUSTARD! Wurskuche provides others like WHOLE GRAIN, DIJON, SPICY BROWN AND AMERICAN YELLOW. I'm adventurous when it comes to food but BOY, these mustards are NO JOKE! Try them lightly. The line to order used to not even reach the outside back in 2012. The wait was never 10 minutes minimum neither! It's no shock that word got around of this BOMB AF spot in the ARTS DISTRICT!

Lamb definitely tastes different from any other meat (like beef or pork etc) but it has found an amazing home at wurstkuche... Yes to lamb ! Also I love that they have a wide variety of hot dog options including some lesser known/eaten meats. (They even have vegetarian options) There were two hot dogs in one bun (both very thin) but I didn't hate it. I will say that the bun was very tough to chew at times but overall a great eat.

They have some that are a bit more tame but if you're waiting forever to get into this joint, go big or go home. I enjoyed all the ones I've tried except for the rabbit, though it might just be a taste preference. I found it too gamey for me and only took one or two bites of it. All the rest were on point. You have a choice of putting sweet pepper, which I definitely recommend. The fries are thick cut and comes with sauces for dipping. My favorite of the ones I've tried is the chipotle aioli and pesto mayo. I have yet to get the beer here but I will in the near future.

We were there around 5/6ish on a Saturday and waited about 20-30 minutes before we ordered. You order then find seating in the back. It's pretty spacious back there, but picnic table seating for the most part. They bring your food to you. Food. Duck sausage with caramelized onions and sweet peppers, a small side of fries and a beer for about $20 give or take. To be honest, everything was extremely salty. The salt overpowered every other taste that was in that meal. That's all I really remember. Maybe I should try another sausage if I ever find myself in the area.

Anyhow, the decor really impressed me.  It was dimly lit on the inside and had cafeteria style lunch tablesIt just screamed hip and modern and was a very cool place.  In terms of hot dogs, that was the best hot dog restaurant I've ever been to."},{"date":"2016-05-23","rating":"3.0","review":"The place was OK.  I think most of the hype comes from it's location and cool atmosphere.  The wursts themselves were just ok (we tried the brat, snake and duck/bacon).  Also, the price of the wieners were pretty good, considering it's a \"hip\" joint .  And boo on the price of fries - it's nice that you get two dipping sauces, but the fries were not super special. Brat breakdown:Original Brat: it was slightly dry, but the best of the 3 we tried.  Nothing special as far as the seasoning, as far as I could tell, but not a bad brat. And the buns were pretty decent.Duck with Bacon:  maybe we got a wiener that was unlucky in the bacon department, but there was hardly a hint of bacon (not sure I even tasted it).  Otherwise, it was lackluster, but not bad tasting.Snake: again, nothing special, except it's interesting to say you've had snake - now mark that off your bucket list.  The flavor was not bad - in fact, it did have an interesting spice to it, but you could have told me it was pork, or cat, or zebra, and I wouldn't have known it was an alternative meat.  But if I were caught stranded in the desert, I would now have no problem eating rattler, if I had to...All in all, a fun place to try, but not a place I would haunt."},{"date":"2015-07-16","rating":"5.0","review":"I seriously can't get enough of their Belgian Fries.

Add some Chipotle ketchup & you have yourself a great meal. Chicken Apple & Spices with caramelize onions & sweet peppers: I decided to try the chicken apple & spices sausage... it comes with apples & specks of cinnamon.

Both locations guarantee you a great meal and an awesome time. I don't usually eat red meat, so I've tried many of the chicken and vegetarian varieties. It's an awesome little hot dog joint with everything from classic sausages to exotic rabbit, crocodile and even rattlesnake! I haven't been brave enough to try these, but I've heard rave reviews. There is a long, extensive beer list that offers something for every palette. The dining area is reminiscent of an Oktoberfest Beer Hall. It's sort of a communal dining experience in that you'll seat yourself at a large picnic style table with other diners. It's a really fun place to come with a big group or for a celebration, just try to get there early to reserve a table because it gets packed. At night, there's usually a DJ present to liven things up. It's honestly a fun spot to just spend an evening out with friends.

This place is unlike any other hot dog place in that they serve some of the most exotic sausages around. They have crazy combinations unavailable anywhere else. With so many choices, I went with a snake and rabbit sausage. I wanted to try something different and that was by far the most interesting choice. What other place serves something like this?The only thing I would say is that I like to eat hot dogs with lots of toppings and condiments and stuff and this place didn't have much of those.

There is a DJ playing loud music and you can get more drinks at the bar. It has a pretty cool vibe. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the food I ordered wasn't that great.

There's communal dining as well as separate tables, but everything's first come first serve so it depends what you can snag. Weekends are exciting since there's usually dj's spinning sick beats.As a vegetarian, this place makes me giddy inside with excitement. All the vegan options are so good!!!  Don't worry meat lovers, obviously there are plenty of meat options too. For the risk takers there's rattlesnake, rabbit, duck, and pheasant. I recommend ordering at least two sausages. Fries are think, crispy and full of deliciousness. Don't get me started on the great selection of dipping sauces. There's 10 to choose from, and even truffle glaze.During this visit it's also crucial that you visit The Pie Hole located right across the street for dessert.

On this occasion I was not at the Kingdom of God but at the Kingdom of Sausages, Wurstkuche! By the end of my visit, all I could think and say was \" Oh my God \" It was so good!Wurstkuche is known for their glorious sausage and anyone that knows me knows I love me some sausage. I don't discriminate and love all kinds of sausage. I love big sausage, thick sausage, juicy sausage, meaty sausage and plump sausage. As long as it looks good and sounds delicious, I'll put it in my mouth.Upon entering, I was already salivating and couldn't wait to satisfy my sausage craving.

Other than pairing it with countless of Belgian and German craft beers, I'm ecstatic about their link offerings ranging from classics, gourmet, and my favorite -- exotics. LOUISIANA HOT LINK ($7) falls under gourmet and is stuffed with beef and pork as well as other spices. Those that love a good kick would appreciate the knockout flavor this has to offer. Add sweet peppers and caramelized onions then you'll have yourself a juxtaposition of sweet and spicy. I would get this if you're feeling unadventurous but appreciate a little heat. Their DUCK & BACON w/ jalapeno peppers ($8) was surprisingly my least favorite of the night as I love duck and come on, who doesn't love bacon? I couldn't detect each unique flavor and the duo just didn't work for me, let alone the overcooked texture of the sausage and dry bun. Care to partake in something a little more exciting? The RATTLESNAKE & RABBIT w/ jalapeno peppers ($8) is a whole other story. It perfectly fits the bill for \"exotic\" while its mild and buttery profiles were to say the least enticing. The onions and spicy peppers which I chose as my toppings married so well with it, plus, I added mustard for that extra \"umph\". Easily my #1 choice that evening.To take it to the next level, their double dipped BELGIAN FRIES ($5.50/L) is not to be missed. A large already comes with two dipping sauces so I went with THAI PEANUT and CURRY KETCHUP for something out of the norm. Yes, their fries are exceptional but their sauces are just as impressive. Varying types of mustard are available (for free) on the tables, therefore, share. So happy they have honey, grain, and regular mustard. Don't let the outside line deter you from coming. Once indoors, you'll have the option to start imbibing from their impressive beer list to make the wait bearable (while still in line). Pay as you order and head straight to the back where communal tables and a bar await you. We went on a Saturday night with a live DJ in the house. You can just imagine the upbeat vibe of the place...it was exhilarating."},{"date":"2016-04-12","rating":"4.0","review":"Man these brats are bomb!

Hahaha we also order a small side of belgian fries with the chipotle sauce. Wait wasn't too bad, we came on a Tuesday night and there was no line at all but as I walk more into the restaurant it was pretty filled up with people.

We didn't know this so we got our waters and had to walk down the hall to grab a table. FOOD: So good! The rattlesnake/rabbit was really juicy. If you told me I was eating pork I would believe you because that's exactly how it taste. Plus you get two topping! Spicy jalapeños and grilled onion for the win yassss.

You can find things like the aforementioned rattlesnake, as well as rabbit and other game meats. They also have a full array of normal beef chicken pork and veggie style sausages. Some of these include variations with srirracha sauce, various herbs and spices, and different types of peppers.You order at what is essentially a meat counter with a cooking window and a couple of beer taps and then head to the back where the seating area is on long communal benches or booths with a full bar.

Also, the fact that they have a single cash register to take the order and pay for every order in this decently large establishment is quite disappointing.   Either open up a second register in the back, or give people a means to order and pay from their phone (Android/Iphone app), and let them just pick up a number from the front counter.The place has serious potential to become a 4 or 5 star place in my book, but due to the reasons I mentioned it is only 3 stars to me right now."},{"date":"2015-05-24","rating":"3.0","review":"We were on our way to The Pie Hole across the street, but decided to stop by here to try their dogs.Saturday. 5pm.  Line out the door.  When you make it to the entrance they have someone there handing out menus and taking beer orders.  They have a huge beer selection, even a $200 option for 6 liters.  They give you your pour while you continue to wait in line to order your food.We finally got to order after being in line for about 15 minutes more or less.  Based on the recommendation of patrons ahead of us they told us to get the filipino sausage and fries with curry ketchup.  Since we weren't too hungry, we just ordered one to share.  But definitely order two or three if your famished.  You can choose two toppings with your sausage, spicy peppers, grilled onions, sweet peppers or sauerkraut.After you pay, they give you a number and then you go down the long hallway to the back to find a table.  They have communal tables as well as private tables.  They also have a bar in their dining area for you to order more beer.As for the sausage, it was good but not worth the $7.  I wish I had opted for the snake or rabbit sausage just to say, \"oh yeah, I've had snake before.\"  For the price, I would have been just as satisfied with a Costco $1.50 polish sausage.  The sausage wasn't bursting with flavor as I was anticipating.  I guess the spicy peppers added a little kick masking the sausage flavor.  The fries were really good though, crisp on tge outside, soft on the inside.  Perfectly fried and paired nicely with the curry ketchup.The crowd here is definitely a rowdy atmosphere.  It's a place to hang out with friends over sausages and beer.Parking is extremely difficult if you don't opt for the overpriced parking lot.  Prepare to go around and around until you get lucky.  Service was friendly."},{"date":"2015-12-27","rating":"4.0","review":"Pros:- wide selection of gourmet and classic sausages- great vibes (music, ambiance, staff, small details)- great beers- two sausages will probably be a mealCons:- long lines- bit on the pricey sideI came pretty early around 5 so luckily there was ample parking and the line was pretty short. A staff came around and took our drink orders while we waited in line, and he recommended a few based on our preferences. We got the beers before we put in our orders, and they were delicious as one would expect from German beer. We got a healthy mix of exotic and classic sausages. It's definitely interesting tasting the different textures from the different meats. The pheasant tasted fairly meaty, rabbit was very gamey, Filipino was... Unique, the lamb was sweet. Definitely worth trying all of them for the novelty factor.Still, my favorites were the classics: Kielbasa and Bratwurst. So if you're hesitant about trying some of the more exotic flavors, then stick to the classics. You can't go wrong. As a final note, they pay great attention to detail to ensure the ambiance is great. Lighting is on the dim side so it's easy to focus on your group even though you're next to other people/tables. There's a DJ playing house tracks that adds to the vibe, and the decor is unique. The tables and chairs are custom shapes, and each type of beer has its own glass.

It's also a German biergarten with some seriousl nice Belgian and German beers on tap....my fav is the Zweikel.

The owners now have added a second location in Venice and though not it's really walking distance to the boardwalk, it is still only a short drive away. The menu seems the same but I haven't been going long enough to know how much it may have changed.I recently ordered a Bratwurst Sausage with caramelized onions and sauerkraut and a glass of Floris Apple Ale. I would suggest ordering a side of Belgian fries that comes with curry ketchup and Chipotle Aioli. The fries are perfectly fried, very crispy outside but soft inside and dipping sauces are very unique and tasty. Can't help going back to try some of their exotic sausages. Would love to try the Alligator & Pork, Smoked Andouille Sausage; and Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers. You have to order your food and beer at the front entrance. After you order and find a place to sit, they will bring your food to the table. This place is quite popular and there is usually a wait in line to be expected. Finding a table/seats are challenging, even though they have a good number of seats. If you want to avoid the crowd, go there before 6 PM or go there after 9:30 PM. I'm so sure that I will go back again.  If you're in the area and you like sausage, Wurstkuche is definitely worth checking out."},{"date":"2015-11-15","rating":"5.0","review":"Food, atmosphere, ambience, neighborhood, beer... All too extraordinary! I don't know why I haven't been here earlier. This place is seriously one of a kind. The neighborhood is super cool; located in the arts district by downtown Los Angeles. Also, we found free street parking rather easily since we came around 5pm. I ordered a weihenstephan beer in line and for food I got the vegetarian smoked Apple sage sausage along with the Belgium fries and a side of chipotle aoli. This was all too good. There was a long line to get in but once you're sitting down you can go up to the bar and order as many beers as you want without waiting. The sausage was amazing! I am usually super bummed when I hear that there are sausages because every single time they are stuffed with meat. Not this time! This was the first sausage I've actually had and I'm super stoked about how amazing it was. Next time I won't get toppings though (peppers and onions) because I rather it be simple. Now for the fries. The fries were addicting and amazing. They were not exuding with grease which made them really great! They were thick and soft. I got the side of chipotle aoli to go with it. It was so tasty! Hands down one of the best aolis I've tried to date.

We went with the rattlesnake, the pheasant, the rabbit, the chicken and apple with spices, and the mango jalepeno, what a mouthful. The pheasant was pleasantly savory, and went well with some onions, kraut, and honey mustard! The rabbit was a bit gamey for my taste, but objectively speaking, still good with the onions. Well the onions were good on everything.The fries were a nice addition to the meal, and I especially enjoyed the variety of sauces to dip them in! Naturally the pesto mayo was delicious, and so was the chipotle ketchup. All in all, great good, nice ambience, and a good variety of drinks as well, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic (mandarin orange jigger was odd at first, but a swig or two after a bite of sausage was really refreshing.)"},{"date":"2015-12-28","rating":"5.0","review":"Great food, great vibe.

Their dogs are certainly not simple ordinary hotdogs. There's exotic flavours and new meats that will raise some brows, but they delicious! They have a large variety of different kinds of dogs, that you can mix and match with the toppings. These with the fries and maybe a cold beer will make your night better.    Last time I came, I wanted to be a bit adventurous and try the rabbit and rattlesnake. It was surprisingly pretty tasty. You can surely tell a bit of a difference with meat, and the aftertaste, but I thoroughly enjoyed my brat. It's meaty and juicy. I got it with fries and an aioli dipping cause. There is also different kinds of mustard on your tables for your convenience. The initial entrance makes it look a bit small, as it is just a store front where you order your meal. Then you go through the long and narrow hallway to the dining area of the restaurant, which is pretty big.The staff is usually friendly, the only struggle is the parking in DTLA.

They have quite the extensive selection of sausages and beer aplenty. There's also vegetarian options, which makes this a great lunch spot for everyone. I had the mango jalapeño and my bf had the chicken apple and spices - both delicious. I liked how it was sweet with a little kick of spice. You can also choose caramelized onions, spicy peppers, or sauerkraut as toppings. If you're feeling adventurous, you can try some of the more exotic meats such as pheasant, rattlesnake, rabbit, etc. We also shared a side of the Belgian fries with Tzatziki (Greek yogurt) sauce and chipotle aioli sauce.

The fries, which we shared, were EXCELLENT. I went with kielbasa for my sausage, with grilled onions. Both my friends went with the vegetarian smoked apple sage. We all felt like, for a place where the sausages are the star, these sausages were good but not amazing. I'd go for a fritzi dog over a wurstkuche dog any day, for example. But, they have a ton of beer on tap and a great atmosphere and we thought it would be fun to go back and just chill on a weekend afternoon with \"beers and brats\" so to speak.

Had to make several laps around the block to finally find a spot. Its in the arts district with a lot of pretentious people walking around.  walked in and great customer service... ordered a Kielbasa dog and ask what IPA's and/or reds they had. Was told the selection was limited since they specialize in Belgians, wheats and pale ales.  I selected a beer with the most hops and sat at the bench. atmosphere was cool, but what I didn't like was the ability for people to bring in their small children in.  There were 3 parties, one with a 10 yr old and 2 with infants.  Just my luck, one of the infants started to cry and the parents ignored it while they drank beer.  Something really awful about getting your drink on while your infant child is screaming.  This place should not allow small children in. It's inappropriate to say the least.So, as I sat there drinking my beer and trying to tune out the crying baby, I had flashbacks of being in a Kindercare, but this time with a cold beer. I finished and walked to the long bar they had to order another beer since the child had calmed down.  I asked the waitress for recommendation. Settled on a beer with the name \"Hopp\" in it. forget what it was but it was tasty. I would go back just for that one beer.Finished and left...

The fresh chewy bun, spicy meat, and crisp snap of the sausage casing was all money.  A-The bratwurst wasn't bad either. I would give it a B. The wedge fries were excellent. I typically don't like wedge fries as I find them too dry. But these were like mash potatoes on the inside and hyper crispy on the outside. AI was initially annoyed by the long line to order the food prior to sitting. But after some thought, I realized it cut down on the waiting time. There are  no unnecessary bottlenecks to idly wait for a table to open up. Its brilliant.

This restaurant is located around the back of little Tokyo where umami, pie hole, etc, is. P A R K I N G:Parking is a hit or miss--sometimes it's really easy to find parking but I've also had to pay for $2 valet about a block away which isn't bad at all. I usually come around 6-7pm and never had to wait more than 10 minutes to order. However, I've walked by around 9-10pm (going to pie hole for dessert hehe), and the line extends beyond the door! F O O D:What's really special about this place are the sausages. They have many exotic flavors such as rabbit and rattle snake--makes me feel super adventurous when eating it, haha! But honestly, if you're afraid, it's sounds crazier than it actually is. You can definitely taste the differences between each type of sausage but overall every sausage is super duper delicious--my personal favorite is the rabbit. You have a choice of adding toppings such as onions and sour kraut onto your hot dog but honestly I am not a big fan of that stuff so I always just eat it as is. They have ketchup and several types of mustard on each table so have fun mixing and matching. Even though the hot dog fills you up pretty well I always order a side of small fries (usually to share with a friend) because their fries (MUST get the one with truffle oil) are DELICIOUS! It's perfectly crispy and thick--it's divine. You get to choose a dipping sauce and they have a very wide selectionm making it very hard to decide on one because I want to try multiple--my personal favorite is the chipotle aoli. They have a bar area at the back of the store which I have yet to try. They also sell a variety of European soft drinks--it's pretty much coke but in a glass bottle, triple the price, and taste a bit different. It's worth a try, but I personally wouldn't order it again cause I'm totally good with water. This place is great to hangout with friends and also for a casual date.

It had a spicy, really bold flavor. They have a nice selection of gourmet sodas.I tried the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers, $8. It was mild tasting as advertised. Perhaps a tad too mild because I could not discern the taste. The sausage had a good snap when I bit into it and I enjoyed the smoky essence.Once the novelty of trying the exotic meats (up until that point, it was the first time I ate either rattlesnake or rabbit in any form) wore off, I quickly determined that it is best to stick with the classic bratwursts and hot links. Nothing, in my opinion, can match the juiciness, smokiness and succulent flavors of pork and beef.There will be a return visit at some point and I trust a higher evaluation will ensue after I try what Wurstkuche is primarily known for: the classic bratwurst and any number of imported beers on tap."},{"date":"2016-03-02","rating":"4.0","review":"Came here finally!!

I ended up going with the rattlesnake, feeling adventurous. It was really good but a lot more subtle in flavors than I expected. I definitely need to come back and try more of their sausages. More importantly, however, is their Belgian fries. After studying in Brussels, all I dreamed about every single day was eating Belgian fries and I have to say Wurstkuche does it perfectly. Not only do they make amazing fries but also have a bunch of dipping sauces (though they should add andalouse and brazil to make it even more Belgian!)The fries were definitely the most satisfying part of the meal.

My personal favorite is the apple sage because it's a little bit sweet a little bit savory, and it handles toppings really well. With any of the sausages that you order you get to pick two toppings (carmelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, spicy peppers) and unlimited mustards - the whole grain is awesome.And you guys, THE FRIES. Oh Lord I could write a whole novel on how delicious the fries here are. Crispy, piping hot, not dripping in grease...AND they have like a million different dipping sauces. I DIE.

I'll be the first to admit that I'm not super knowledgeable about beer, but the bartenders here are really friendly and will help you out if you have an idea of what you're looking for. As far as non-alcoholic beverages (pssh, really?) they DO have free cucumber water, which is super refreshing and delicious. The ambiance of this place is cool and fun, and there's always plenty of seating a their long \"mess-hall\" style tables and benches - I love that it's not stuffy at all.

There are unique offerings such as rattlesnake and rabbit as well as vegan sausages.

The bar serves only beer and wine but one can't go wrong with a sausage and a beer (Spaten Optimator for me, thank you!). There are no sweets and the sodas are just as eclectic as the range of flavors of sausages - Fentiman's Dandelion and Burdock.

I went back last weekend for the first time in a year or so. First off, it's gotten crazy busy. Every time I drive by it, there's a line snaking its way out the door and down the street. So that sucks. But they get you a beer while you wait, so it helps the lengthy line standing you endure. FOOD: Bratwursts: Mango & Jalapeno. Out of all the brats I've tried, this one rose to the top! Top it with caramelized onions and spicy peppers and you're good to go. Belgian Fries: Always Groot size (large). Sadly, when I was there this weekend, their recipe has changed. My friend noticed the difference as well. Still, it's delicious. I'd recommend the curry ketchup and sriracha aioli to go with it. DRINK: Their beer menu is so extensive, I end up trying a new one every time. You can't really go wrong here. VIBE: It's loud, crowded, but a ton of fun.

The chicken apple & spices was a safe choice and tasted good. The vegetarian hot dog was actually one of the most disgusting things I have ever tasted in my life. I don't think even vegetarians would like it. Stick to the real meats and you can't go wrong with that."},{"date":"2015-06-04","rating":"5.0","review":"Not a sausage/hotdog person AT ALL and I absolutely love this place. It's like stepping into a hip bar complete with live DJ (on certain nights!) and gourmet eats that won't break the bank.Chicken Apple & Spices - didn't taste much apple or spices, so no worries on the seemingly strange flavor. You'll only taste the chicken and get two sausages in the bun since they're smaller. Vegetarian Chipotle - if you're a vegetarian that enjoys a flavor kick, the spices are strong. Fries - Blue Cheese Walnut & Bacon and Chipotle Aioli for dipping sauce. Didn't like the Thai Peanut as much since it doesn't go with any of the other food haha.The different kinds of mustards are fun to try also! My favorite is the whole grain for a less processed mustard taste. Go easy on the condiments though. Lots of the sausages are bursting with flavor, so take a bite before piling on ketchup/mustard! Drinks: grapefruit beer :)"},{"date":"2016-01-28","rating":"4.0","review":"I was at Wurstküche earlier today. Had a bratwurst with hot peppers and sauerkraut on top, small fries with tzatziki  side sauce. The hot peppers were actually hot/spicy which I was very happy about, the fries were big and lovely, the side sauce as well. My drink of choice was the black cherry which was sweet and lovely but if I would order this again I would probably prefer a glass of water for those spicy peppers and then top it off with the soda afterwards or while waiting. I also got to taste the ketchup chipotle side sauce which first had a sweetness to it but then a lovely spicy sting hits you, definitely something I will order next time. All in all a great experience and would love to return soon. Only complaint would be that people that ordered after you might get food before you. This happened at our table, my friends were almost done eating before I got my order."},{"date":"2015-12-01","rating":"5.0","review":"The hype for these hot dogs is real.

The fries are thick cut steak fries and fried a bit more than other places. Overall it was a delicious meal, where both the sausage and the fries were tastier than other places. If you're looking for a unique twist on hot dogs, definitely check this place out.The only drawback is finding parking in the arts district.

It looks like a small closed off place from the outside, even though there is a small seating area on the back side of the restaurant.When we entered, a girl quickly gave us a menu and asked us if we would like to order our drinks while we waited. It was a hot Sunday afternoon, of course we were game! She asked us what we would like to eat, because according to what we were going to order she was going to suggest the proper beers that go perfectly with.I couldn't decide so I ordered both Sun Dried Tomato & Mozzarella sausage and Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapeno Peppers. She she suggested that I select one of the beers under the German Beers section, and so I did. mY Boyfriend ordered the Buffalo, Beef & Pork With Chipotle Peppers and also ordered a German beer with his meal. The cool part about it was that they gave us our beers while we waited in line to order our food. We also added the Belgian Fries with Chipotle Sauce and Sundried Tomato Mayo. They gave us our order # and told us to go grab a seat and our food will be out shortly.We decided to sit outside, because it was a gorgeous day out in LA. The crowd there is very hipster. Everyone was dressed in very unique outfits and did not look typical. Our food came out, and they were right about the shortly part. I took my first bite from my Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapeno Peppers hot dog and WOW! My taste-buds were going crazy! I definitely did not expect to like it that much. It was very tender and juicy, yet very rich and thick in flavor. The caramelized onions and the sweet red peppers were the perfect additions. Then it was the Sun Dried Tomato & Mozzarella turn. That was for sure my favorite. It was a bit spicy, but just enough to enjoy the rest of the flavors that burst out of it. I took a break to try the Belgian fries, and lets just say I AM ADDICTED! The Sundried Tomato Mayo was definitely my favorite. After we ate, we walked around a bit and checked out the cool art stores around the area and the amazing graffiti that graced the walls of Downtown LA. I for sure am a fan and will recommend this place to all my friends and family."},{"date":"2015-09-15","rating":"4.0","review":"I don't like hot dogs, but whoever invented these hot dogs here did an amazing job.

The dipping sauces are amazing. I love the bbq one. My favorite so far is the hot link hot dog. also, don't forget the steak fries. Those are definitely to die for! Great affordable price.

We decided to go against the yelp reviews and got what he recommended. It was a mixed bags of regret and relief. The Filipino is good because it was nicely spiced and flavored but the rattlesnake/rabbit though nicely spiced, texture-ly was a bit tough and didn't taste that great.The truffle oil on the fries don't make much of a difference. The curry ketchup is interesting but definitely hands down get the chiptole ketchup. They have a lot of sauces for you to get on the side. They were interesting. Not a big fan of the bread.It is a bit thick and lacks flavor. It doesn't compliment the sausages that well. You can order the hot dog wtih out the bread and they just put a bed of toppings on the bottom of the plate. Seating can be a challenge. It is benches on the inside and tables scattered inside and outside. Depending on how large groups are, it might be hard to squeeze yourself into sections of the bench."},{"date":"2015-11-14","rating":"5.0","review":"The hype is real. Wurstkuche is pretty legit. They range from your common bratwurst to the exotic rattlesnake and rabbit. The line is fairly long for a poppin' Saturday in LA. But at least as soon as you get through the door, you can stand in line and chat while sipping on a glass of your beer of choice, with many many options. I ordered the duck and bacon and their limited time gummy bear bratwurst to share with my friends. The duck and bacon is very savory yet slightly salty. It has a nice hint of bacon after taste. Unfortunately, the gummy bear bratwurst is not a fan favorite. I sadly did not get a gummy bear in my portion when divided. The consensus is that the gummy bear is weird. The most popular item here is the truffle oil fries and their selection of custom ketchups."},{"date":"2016-04-09","rating":"5.0","review":"Was good, i had the veggie dog (there were three kinds i got the mexican chipotle) and my friend got the sun dried tomato dog.  The servers are very kind and friendly too!The line took awhile but we got to order drinks and drink while in line so it was a plus!Plenty of seating in the back!We parked at a lot across the street for $10 when we got back it was $15, most of the lots arax $12 so i would park there if you go around 2 pm."},{"date":"2016-06-16","rating":"4.0","review":"Although a little on the pricey side, I was very happy with the taste and topping of my dog as well as the french fries.

To date, I've tried the Mango Jalapeno, Pheasant, Bockwurst, Bratwurst and I had to try the Rattlesnake Rabbit one. Oh, can't forget the fries.Out of all of them, I think my favorite has to be the Mango Jalapeno. It's tender and sweet with a mild kick at the end. Delicious. The Pheasant, I'd say would be next, it's juicy and flavorful. The Bockwurst is mushier version of the Brat, I'd recommend the latter for a fuller flavor. I tried the Rattlesnake-Rabbit one just for the experience. It was tough, peppery and gamey. I don't think I'll be having that again, but it was a thrill.The ambiance is fantastic. Set up like a hipster bar, most of the seating is communal, so you'd either have to reach over someone else or ask them to to pass the mustard.Lots of beer on tap, and some more in bottles.

I wanted to try something a little different for lunch and wound up here after hearing so many great things! From the outside, the place looks like a small to go lunch spot. I had no idea there was a place to sit in the back, until one of the waiters pointed it out for us. The decor is modern and sleek, but feels cold from all the metal and lack of color. I did like the designs they had for the numbers.  We ordered the veal bockwurst and the rattle snake and rabbit with sweet peppers and caramelized onions for toppings. Our food came out quickly with excellent service. I was actually surprised by the size of my bockwurst. It's about the size of a small hotdog. For $6.50, I was expecting to be filled at the very least. The veal bockwurst was tender and juicy, but did not have much flavor besides the toppings. The rattle snake and rabbit had a great spicy kick to it and made for a better meal. I did like trying out all the different mustards they had to offer from grainy to honey, which made eating more experimental and fun. I recommend the spicy mustard for anyone ordering the veal. It adds the flavor needed to this plain sausage. I'd probably come back here with a large group of friends for some more adventurous eating since I have been eyeing the buffalo/ pork and the belgian fries."},{"date":"2016-01-27","rating":"5.0","review":"Tucked in a little corner in the Arts District is Wurstkuche, the best place around for a really unique sausage experience. The atmosphere and the food are just fantastic, this place deserves 5/5 100%. Don't turn away if you see a line at the door, it's absolutely worth any wait. I love that Wurstkuche is a really casual spot for a chill evening but it's still lively since it attracts a crowd. Ordering is simple at the counter and they offer a wide variety of sausages ranging from gourmet, exotic, and simple. I always go for the duck bacon sausage because it is just loaded with a flavor that I love. Everyone I've been here with has loved the sausage they order as well. I'm not too sure if I'd try the rattlesnake but I'll never say never :) the Belgian style fries are super good and they have a bunch of dipping sauces to choose from to accompany the fries. After ordering, walking to the back is a big surprise. I'd never guess how big the seating area is from looking at the outside but there are big community tables along with smaller tables. The best part is that they have a bar in the back so you can grab a beer throughout any point in your meal. Definitely a smart move to avoid sending customers back to the line at the front. Eating at Wurstkuche is always a good time. The hardest part about eating here is deciding which sausage to try, but I bet you can't go wrong!"},{"date":"2016-04-27","rating":"4.0","review":"I love this place.

Seeing that receipt filled me with instant regret.This place has gotten a lot of hype, so I expected to be more impressed. When it came down to it, the sausage just didn't blow my mind...I wanted the Filipino sausage but they were out, so I took the cashier's suggestion of the lamb sausage, which I'd also been eyeing. Got it topped with caramelized onions. The bread was more than just a bun, and although I liked the softness, it totally overtook the sausage. You get a variety of sauces to top your sausage at the table, which I liked. The fries lack any seasoning, so make sure you choose the dipping sauces wisely. The bleu cheese was a winner; pass on the chipotle ketchup. You can use the ketchup and many mustards at your table to spice it up.Maybe I'll give this place another shot and order a beer, as people seem to be raving about those. But for the sausage alone... I was not as impressed as I wanted to be. Do I have to try the most exotic flavors to be blown away? I'll go for the rabbit or alligator next time and let you know."},{"date":"2015-02-25","rating":"4.0","review":"Exotic sausages only. I'm been going to Wurstkuche for years and I seriously am always down to come back for the exotic sausages, mustards, amazing fries, and all the beers. So basically everything. I stay stuntin' on that rattlesnake and rabbit. There aren't a lot of places in California where you can get that combination... or have it be as delicious as it is. The fries (usually) are perfectly crisp on the outside and well-cooked potato-y goodness on the inside. Dip it with the chipotle aioli and the variety of mustards.That's probably my favorite thing about Wurstkuche (besides having the exotic sausages): the variety of mustards. I can never really make a solid decision between whole grain, dijon, honey, and spicy. So I happily alternate.I generally love the ambiance but it gets a little hard when the place is packed and you're trying to have a conversation with someone.

A bit pricey for what it is at $6.RATTLESNAKE AND RABBIT SAUSAGE W/ CARAMELIZED ONIONS AND HOT PEPPERS:Overhyped and overpriced, in my opinion.  Got this one after hearing about it all over Yelp. The meat was a bit tougher than the bratwurst but nothing really discernible in terms of taste to separate it from other types of normal sausages that I've tried before. For $8 a pop definitely not worth it.GROOT FRIES:Large fries with your choice of two dipping sauces. I chose the buttermilk ranch and the chipotle aioli. The sauces complimented the fries well, and the fries were thick, greasy and good. For those of you that prefer the thin cut fries like the ones at McDonald's, bummer.Overall, a cool place to hang out with the friends and decent food but way too overpriced for the amount of food that you get. I will never go out of my way to come back here, only if I find myself in the neighborhood and the line isn't ridiculously long.

(That was a joke by the way...cuz otherwise I would have serious medical issues and would probably need to see a doctor if I could really do that with my bellybutton).  The seating area is in the back and opens to a huge room with picnic bench style seating, a nice large bar in the back, and a dj playing tunes while you eat and hang out.  Very chill atmosphere and def worth checking out if youre in DTLA."},{"date":"2016-01-21","rating":"3.0","review":"Love this place, hate the line.

I've never had pheasant before but the skin coating the hot dog was very light and easily broken into. The meat was juicy and tender. The bun was white bread and grilled on the fryer. It was large enough the encase the entire hot dog which is not something that happens very often. If you've ever wondered why hot dogs are so messy it's because the buns are too small the good stuff doesn't have a pocket to sit in.

They have everything from your standard Brat, to Duck with Bacon and Jalapeno, to Rattlesnake, and the beer menu doesn't disappoint either. I have to admit, I was expecting exorbitant prices, but they are in fact quite reasonable. My wife and I each had a sausage, we split an order of large fries, and we both had beers for under $30. Not too bad, especially when you consider this place is in DTLA.If for some reason I'm back out that way, it's definitely a stop worth making."},{"date":"2015-07-20","rating":"4.0","review":"Two Words: Wurt itI had this on the same day I had Pink's. Substantially better than Pink's. The ambiance is pretty upbeat and fun. The crowd looks like I was surrounded by lumberjacks - dudes with beards and flannels (not judging, of course ;). I ordered the rattlesnake and rabbit. This sausage was packed full of flavor. You could tell that the sausages are fresh. My only wish is that their buns didn't overpower the sausage. The dog to bun ratio is lacking.If it is busy, grab a beer. They have a wide beer selection. You'd be a fool if you skip out on their belgian fries. Fresh and crispy.This place is not just a place to eat, but to hang out and meet some cool people.For parking, good luck! Plenty of street parking. But, I'd go for a (paid) parking lot.

Only thing that bothers me is the ridiculous lines/seating on the weekends! But its that good so its expected.I'm not really much of a hot dog person but these are pretty tasty...and so many options! I'm not a sausage connoisseur but I would say there is something for everyone....I've tried a couple... and every one was good but my fav is always the hot link....I love spicy everything so this was an obvious choice. Yum! You get to pick 2 free toppings from sweet peps/spicy peps/grilled onion/kraut... I usually go with the spicy peppers and either the onions of kraut depending on my mood...The fries here are BOMB (so gooooodddd). You pick a sauce with your order...cant go wrong with the chipotle mayo. I think I got the truffle oil on the fries once because I love truffle fries and it wasn't too noticeable even though it was more expensive... so eh I usually get the regular ones.Now beer wise... this place is my beer heaven... I don't like beer that much but when it comes to Belgian and German beers I adore them. Those are most of their selection so I am always a happy camper. My fav is St. Bernardus..try it! My advice is to come when its not busy to really enjoy the food... and come when its busy to drink their delicious beer..and maybe get food when your buzz can entertain you in line."},{"date":"2016-05-12","rating":"4.0","review":"I do enjoy visiting the location in the arts district/ little tokyo area.

My BF got the pheasant & it had a spicy kick to it. The Belgian truffle fries were to die for! You get to pick two sauces & we got ranch & pesto mayo. OMG! Delicious and addicting!

I'll be brief since there is nothing to mention here that hasn't been mentioned. I remember the first time I came I loooved the variety of beers and sausage this place offered. Even though the line can be long, it is well worth it. I've tried a few sausages and the Rattlesnake is the most unique. I sometimes get the sausage to go and head over to Angel City Brewery. Don't get me wrong, it is not that their beers suck (they are actually pretty darn good), its that its get crowded here!Overall, pretty good and unique spot. Lines are long but it moves fast. Sausages are grilled to order. Beers are amazing.

While some places close up for the day, this spot stays open late. It tends to get crowded later into the night as options become limited.So why all the fuss over this spot, honestly cannot say it's bad. But dig that they offer exotic meats other than your plain pork or beef items.The interior of the spot is dimly lit perfect in case you don't want to pretty yourself up. ;) they have a good selection of beers and non-alcoholic drinks. Large seating area that has more of a bar atmosphere. The crowds it draws are quite loud and energetic. Wouldn't recommend for those seeking a more intimate ambiance. But hey it only lets you whisper in each others ear. Just make sure not spit in it or you'll lose points. Enjoyed my first visit and will eventually check out again, not a bad way to end the night."},{"date":"2015-08-17","rating":"4.0","review":"Besides the place being pretty expensive, its an experience to come here, especially before or after a Dodgers game. Be advised, this place will be packed during game days. So if you're planning on eating here before a game, schedule accordingly. I've only been here before games, but I heard during the night, it sure does get busy, and they have a DJ/band playing during the weekend. Food, as you may see they serve hot dogs! Yes delicious hot dogs with unique and exotic meats. They also have some of the most delicious french fries ever, and they serve beer! During my first visit, I went with the most exotic thing they had, rattle snake! The hot dog itself was really good. It definitely is not your regular hot dog. So many flavors, especially with the bell peppers it comes with. They also have bottles of different kinds of mustard, honey mustard, spicy brown mustard, you name it! They are all delicious. Price, like I said, these are not cheap. A meal for two, which would include  a hot dog, fries and a drink can easily add up to $40 or more! Which is why, it's good to come here once in a while. Service, is nothing sort of amazing. You wait in line, they ring you up, and they bring you your food. The wait is not to long. From the time you wait in line to the time you get your food is probably about 15 minutes. Ambiance, the location of this place almost feels like a hole in the wall if you are not familiar with the area. You can easily miss the small opening to the place, The only sign of the place would probably be the long line starting from the outside. The area where you order your food is a teeny tiny area, but once you walk to the back, the place opens up to tables and rows of tables for a cafeteria like seating, but with a hip style to it. More than likely, you will find a seat just fine.Overall, you have to check this place out at least once when in LA. The weekends I would say is the best time to go."},{"date":"2016-03-09","rating":"4.0","review":"Chicken apple with green onions hot dog. Definitely an experience! I've sworn to stay away from hot dogs 4 years ago after discovering what was actually put into those little meat sausages, but I broke my promise to myself after really craving a hot dog for some reason recently. I figured, if I'm breaking my four year long hot dog boycott, it better be good, and it better be, different. I didn't want your average Dodger dog. A friend of mine who's really into the food scene suggested this place a while back, and I always dismissed it. I figured, how fancy can hot dogs get?!Well, Wurstkuche really delivered on the \"different\" front. My chicken apple with onions hotdog  was delicious, and the truffle fries that came with it were well worth the 1 year they shaved off my life.

Things to try:- Rattlesnake sausage: tastes like chicken, very lean meat and a novelty if you want to tell people you've tried rattlesnake. It's got some spice and a nice bite to it- Buffalo sausage: not gamey but very similar to beef. Tastes like a normal hot dog except for the fact it's not a normal hot dog- Duck/bacon sausage: my favorite. Very rich in flavor, oily, juicy, and smoky- Fries: order with curry ketchup and blue cheese walnut/bacon dip.Seating in the back indoor or outdoor, parking on the street or $10 for one of the lots, and located in a grungy artsy ghetto neighborhood filled with skinny jean wearing hipsters.

Everyone in our party seemed pretty satisfied with their hot dogs but not overly wowed. I think the best part was the convenient bar located near the tables which made it easy for everyone to keep a fresh beer handy. Hence the stars for being a good spot to grab a bite and hangout for a bit. I'm not sure I would crave to go back but I can imagine stopping in again if we're in the area.

They have a few meatless and non pork/red meat options. A sausage house isn't exactly where you think to take your vegetarian friend but we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. All sausages range between $6-8. Vegetarian and classic options are the cheapest. They do a great job of keeping the consistency and flavor of veggie options on point w a normal sausage. Exotics are the most \"expensive\" which include sausages w rattlesnake, rabbit and other interesting meats. I ordered a vegetarian Italian with the intention of trying an exotic one if I was still hungry. One is more than enough, especially with an order of fries (which I split). I really enjoyed the chipotle dipping sauce. Beer selection is awesome but a little on the spendy side. Granted they are exotic beers, not your typical coors or bud. The sizes vary too. Both my strawberry and grapefruit beers were super delicious and priced about the same but one was practically a stein and the other was hardly as big as a martini. The grapefruit one was bigger.

Though I must say I really did like the cherry soda I got.I menu is fairly simple, you have a choice of classics, gourmet and exotic sausages. I got the rabbit and snake sausage, which is on the exotic list. Once you pick your sausage you have two choices of either; caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers or hot peppers. I did the caramelized onions and sweet peppers! I got to say, I enjoyed my sausage a lot. It was good, filling and the caramelized onions and sweet peppers were great; added some nice favors to the meaty sausage. The snake and rabbit was a good pick!

Don't overlook the Mexican Chipotle just because it may not be as exotic as other menu items. It's delicious! They also serve their sausages on a freshly baked roll, while allowing you to add two of the four following options to any order: spicy peppers, sweet peppers, caramelized onions, and sauerkraut. They also have gourmet mustards, in the back for self serve which include: whole grain, dijon, spicy brown, honey mustard, american yellow, and ketchup.

The parking is a B*tch lol but that is the only problem. Once we found parking, the line was out the door and down the way. That is a great sign for a goOd time. I thought this was going to be a horrible wait. Turned out, the line moved pretty quickly and the employees made the line experience easy. First, while outside, a employee walked out and gave out menus to everyone & even offered personal favorites on beer, food, etc. Once we got to the door, they took our drink orders and offered to give it to us while we wait or when we finish the order. I thought that was awesome! Of course I took my drink in line because why not lol.Here is what you guys want to know; the food: well one sec! Let me tell you about the restaurant. The restaurant is a upscale Gastropub with a bar in the seating area. They have 4 huge family style bench tables and personal tables on a step up platform. They also have about 20-25 outdoor seating. We sat down and put our numbers out for the waiters to see and enjoyed our beers and the loud, fun atmosphere. O yeah, the food! So I was able to taste multiple hot dogs & sausages and they all had a unique taste that entertained your tastebuds. I enjoyed all of them. The fries are thick cut and come with a choice of two sauces. I mean I can go on forever on this place! We all left this place full, tipsy, and happy.

Such a great idea. I love how quick everything is here. I come here on my lunch and eat within 45 minutes, although I work in downtown, and it's pretty close from there... The service is very quick. You can order your food/beer, sit/chill, eat, then sit and chill again, arriving back to work on time not a minute late with no rush...The menu is interesting... A notice a lot of people get kind of crazy with it and order new and fancy stuff which is pretty cool, and I would but I always know what I order is going to be amazing so I always get the same thing... Yeah I'm that guy. Although plain in nature, I get a bratwurst and fries, the blue cheese for the fries is so good and I'm not even a fan of blue cheese?!? Seriously though, I know that every single time it's going to be a winner with that order, and some times, when I'm hungry I think about that order...Anyways, if you haven't gone, go... You'll find parking somehow, just think positive! Maybe even see some models modeling, some artists arting,? Who knows? You'll find out a new favorite spot.

I've never had a gourmet hot dog before but after I tried this one, I think I'm hooked. I was looking for something I couldn't find anywhere else, so the chef recommended me the Pheasant. Its actually made from a pheasant...that was very...unique so I gave it a try. It was one of the most flavorful hot dogs I've ever had. Now I can see why there is such a thing as gourmet hot dogs. Always go with a side of their truffle fries. Get the buffalo ranch or the tzatziki if you're feeling light. They have a variety of mustards at each table too. My personal favorite was the whole grain mustard. The best mustard I've ever had (and I'm not a mustard person)."},{"date":"2016-05-10","rating":"4.0","review":"Best fries I've ever had.

Little did I know what I was in for.The order taker implored that I try the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers Sausage and of course I opted in for the Belgian Fries. Within ten minutes my meal arrived and I knew it was something special just by the sight of things. Rattlesnake & Rabbit; I know exactly what you are thinking. You are wrong. It is glorious. The snap of the casing yields way to possibly the most delicate meat I have ever tried in incased meat format and the bold, savory spices completely are complimented by the fiery finish thanks to the Jalapeños. The bun was a bit too large but that was easily fixed by tearing off the surplus and next time around I may even forgo the bun as it is just filler once the Sausage hits the palette. Wurstküche makes one damn fine Sausage. The Fries were quite good as well, certainly a 4 star even in their own right, but I will opt for overcooked next time to get a better exterior. Paired with Mustard, the perfect compliment to the Sausage.They offer numerous Craft Beers I could not partake in thanks to it being a business power lunch, but my return is most certain. Wurstküche is the realness."},{"date":"2016-02-24","rating":"5.0","review":"I'm not into hotdogs. Thought I'd try it because have heard people talk about it too many times. BLOWN AWAY!

Super long line, cool exterior with vines on the wall. Was very pleasantly surprised to find it a German gastropub instead!I was a little confused as to where the hoards of people were disappearing to after they ordered at the counter, but the narrow hallway will take you to a large room with communal seating. There's an outdoor area as well. The ambience in the room was perfect - loud, bustling, dim lighting, nobody throwing things so that's good. Just people trying to enjoy some hot dogs and beer!Tons of great sausages to choose from, at an affordable price too. Their double dipped fries were on the fatter/fluffier side for me, but honestly they had me at the sauces: pesto mayo and tzatziki?! Why are these not regular sauces anywhere else?!

I guess the beer selection might? But really, you can just go to BevMo in the time it takes to order. Some days, the wait can be 30-60 minutes.I've tried their more classical beef bruts to their more exotic buffalo snake bruts and they all taste somewhat different. What they share in common is that the bun definitely overpowers the sausage because of how little meat you get relative to the bun.If it were not for hanging out in the Arts District, I don't think I would make a trip to this place specifically to eat or drink."},{"date":"2015-12-07","rating":"3.0","review":"I've always heard of this place, passed by, you name it. but it never came to mind to actually try it. simply because I wouldn't necessarily choose to go out to eat a hot dog. but, that was before I knew they were famous because of their popular exotic meats that are incorporated into their hotdogs. which made more sense to me. the wait on a Saturday night is no joke, but I would say the line moves fairly quick. when you make your way pass the door, there are employees that will ask whether you have any questions or would like to start with a drink. once you order, you have the option to take it to go, walk to the back(sounds a bit sketchy) where they have a huge room where they have a bar and seating area, or even outside!) I was a bit overwhelmed when it came to ordering because there were so many odd combinations! rabbit, rattlesnake, etc. I mean... that's pretty random and exotic to me. but, no sorry I don't have the guts to actually try it haha. you're able to pick two toppings with your hot dog, which include: sour kraut, caramelized onions, sweet peppers, or spicy peppers. I went with the jalapeño mango hot dog with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. one hot dog looked quite large to me, so I stuck with one. my boyfriend went with the exotic ones, I forgot but he said that one was better than the other. but they were both good and exotic. so I guess it wouldn't necessarily hurt to try it. then we ordered a large order of fries! ohhhh my goodness. something about their French fries are quite addicting! they're huge, and the texture is perfect. with the large order of fries, you have the option of two dipping sauces. GET the CHIPOTLE AOILI!! so good and won't disappoint. we also got the curry ketchup, which was okay to me. they also have drinks that are quite different from other places. I noticed cucumber soda, ginger beer, etc. I tried the ginger beer and it didn't even taste like beer, it was more like soda with ginger flavoring. I'm not a fan of ginger at all, I thought it was ok. I personally wouldn't order it myself. overall, really good place! but I'd only go if my friends want it.

Nope it was open and we walked in.We sit down at the first table once inside waiting for service. Waiting and waiting and waiting. Well, apparently nobody serves you or says anything to you. You have to walk up to the bar and order food and drinks. Oh wait though, where's the menu? Not at the table, the bar has those too and they keep them stashed in a drawer. Okay??? What am i supposed to order if you keep the menu's hidden and nobody is serving us? So finally we get the menu and its lacking so many German food items. Then we start laughing about this ridiculous experience. Place is completely bland. Hardly feels German and nobody helps you.

Mark up front (awesome guy with the \"kid-n-play\" flattop fade) was pleasantly exuberant and had an extensive comprehension of the delicious different beers on tap, and helped me pick the absolute perfect beer to go with my food. In the dining room, Kat brought out our food and gave us exemplary service during the whole time we were dining with a sincere smile, making us all feel like old friends.

Fat line for the food, so I am going to assume it is good. Take the back entrance if you're just there to order food, no need to go to the huge line. Back entrance is the door on the corner of the street. Enter and you see long tables and the bar. Head over to the bar and the beers are organized by type (German, Belgian, etc.). They were out of the beer I originally tried to order and the bartender was kind enough to let me sample other types based on what I was looking for.

I also got a side of small fries with curry ketchup. When the food arrived, it looked and smelled delicious. However, it was only okay. The hot dog was a little dry and not as juicy as I expected, and the fries were good- nothing special though. I still really enjoy their options of sauce here; I love how there's a huge variety of mustard as well as sauces for the fries and hot dogs! My overall impression of this place was okay.

I finished my meal and seriously considered going back for seconds, but I still had my extra delicious beer to finish, oh yeah I forgot about my beer because the deliciousness of the sausage blinded me from all else.The restaurant decor is cool too, fits well with the rest of the arts district, industrial, laid back, and filled with hipsters.

I waited for about 10-20 min to order my food and the staff were attentive and friendly. The staff would come out to great their customers in line and offer them a menu to look at. The food selection is great therefore it makes it a tad bit hard to select what you want to eat/try, so order two or three.... I had the Louisiana hotlink and it was delicious.

What you have here is the highest quality and most unique german sausage indoor beer garden right in the center of LA. They have sausage from the standards all the way up to the exotic. Snake and Rabbit? Yes, predator and prey all in one. Its like a million year old battle that you can consume in all its grilled glory, then wash it down with a huge selection of amazing beers. Oh ya, beer. You wont find a better selection of bavarian beers anywhere, nor stranger non-alcoholic beverages. If you don't know what to order just ask! DID I FORGET TO MENTION THE FRIES! I'm not going to say anything other than, just order the hell out of them. Done.You will likely be in line for a little while. Outside along the building you might get handed a menu and its a great read and conversation piece. Once you end up inside, they will offer you to order a beer. Then you will get your turn to look into the sausage case and make your order. Once you get all that setup, just walk down the hall and find a nice seat indoors or outdoors. If you like music stay indoors for the DJ. One thing to keep in mind, once you are done ordering you have to go back into the line to get more, so order enough! You can still order more beer and wine at the bar indoors.So don't fear the line, its actualy a great part of the experience.

I ordered the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage with peppers and caramelized onions, the pheasant sausage with sauerkraut and sweet peppers, and a side of small fries with the chipotle aioli. Fries were awesome and between the pheasant and the rattlesnake/rabbit sausages, I would recommend the pheasant sausage. If you dine-in, they'll serve you your order. If you order a drink, they're suppose to give it to you before you head on out to the beer hall and find your seat. If you sit on the benches, they have crayons on the table where you can doodle away on the paper-lined table. Their service was awesome and attentive. I don't know if they were just attentive to me, but they checked up on me, asked how my food was, and were really overall nice. I would have to commend their spot-on customer service."},{"date":"2016-04-10","rating":"5.0","review":"Bougie hotdog goodness. Had the mango jalapeño w/grilled onions and sweet peppers.

Not only do they get to check out the beautiful Arts District, they get to chill, kick back, eat a weiner and drink some beer.I've tried a bunch of sausages at WurstKuche these past few years of living in Los Angeles, but I'm officially very confident when I say that the Sun-dried Tomato and Mozzarella sausage is my favorite! I also love, love, love the Peach Soda. Oh, and the fries! Must get it with truffle oil glaze. The aioli sauce is on point! For those who have small stomachs like I do, trust when I say that this meal is deceptively filling.The bad thing about Wurstkuche is that it's usually packed, so go when you have some time to kill. Not only does it take awhile to order your sausage, but after paying, you still have to deal with finding an empty table! Damn you for being so popular! However, they make the wait a bit more tolerable since you can drink while waiting in line. They also have a nice patio area where you can dine outside."},{"date":"2016-03-08","rating":"2.0","review":"Overrated. Even without the wait it's overrated. Been here a handful of times whenever someone comes to visit and needs to try it out. Huge markup on the sausages especially the \"exotic\" ones. Expect a huge line during weekend nights. Sausage was tiny looking in the bun. The best thing about the overcooked sausage with a huge side of bread were the mustards and the beer that helped it down. If you're looking for it, the entrance is right across the street from the piehole but the location extends to the street corner. Just dont go in through the street corner door since that's where you look for your own seats and not where you order."},{"date":"2016-01-10","rating":"4.0","review":"An unusal dining experience.  This was not what I expected.  There's a small counter ordering area up front.  In the back is a large dining room with bar.Wow, so many types of sausages to try.  Different types of mustards at the table to accompany the wurst.  I'm impressed."},{"date":"2015-10-12","rating":"5.0","review":"Somewhere in Little Tokyo/Art District lies a great place with a variety of beers and sausages to grub on!! I love the atmosphere and decor, although it's very simplistic. Upon entering you can order your food and first round of drinks first, take a number, and self-seat anywhere you like. The servers will bring your food to you. They have different kinds of mustard to choose from as well. On weekends there's a DJ from what I recall. Certain nights it's so crowded that seating can be hard to find. I think I've tried a handful of the sausages and they were all equally flavorful. The exotic ones are always fun to try. Parking isn't the best here, as is the rest of LA... But eventually you can either find street parking or pay a fee in some lots."},{"date":"2015-04-14","rating":"4.0","review":"Came here a few months back and recently visited it again.  Quality is consistently delicious!  If you are looking for a simple meal with a pint of cold beer, this is the place to be.  Line can get crazy long if you go during peak hours.  Their seating area is quite ample even though it may not seem like it where you order.  Its down the hall to your left.Whatever dog or waurst you get, must get their fries!  Its pretty legit.  They are meaty version and not the thin/skinny cuts.  You get to choose two different dipping sauce to go with your fries.  I prefer the Aioli sauce above all.  Quite the flavor.  So there is three category that you can choose from: Classic, Gourmet, and Exotic.  I ordered the Mango Sausage the first time and the Duck and Bacon on my second visit.  Both were tender and juicy.  You get to choose 2 our of the 4 toppings with your order.  Sauerkraut and grilled onions for me on both orders.  Its held in a fresh toasted bun which gives it a nice cushion to absorb the juice and mustard.  On the table has 5 choices of sauce to top your order as well.  Ketchup, mustard, spicy mustard, dijon, and something else that's escaping me at the moment. I would give this a 5 star but the sausage size is a little lacking.  Ratio is a bit off.  Had it been a little bigger, 5 stars all the way.  For hungry individuals or those who can eat, you may want to order two sausages.  All in all, pay this place a visit and you'll understand why this place has over 5k of reviews.   Its out of this world delicious!"},{"date":"2016-02-02","rating":"5.0","review":"Rattlesnake and rabbit hot dog!!

I love all the different beer and soda options paired with the limited menu so you don't feel *too* overwhelmed.The seating is communal which can be a blessing or a curse, depending on your timing. They put all the different mustards out on the tables for you to pick and choose and they offer free (cucumber?) water which is also nice. The sausages for me though were much more basic than I had expected and I felt that they got lost in the massive rolls. The first and last bites are all bread! I tried the bratwurst (way too much nutmeg) the hot link (tasted as expected) and the duck & bacon (definitely the best of the three). My mom and brother both had the rabbit and rattlesnake and said it was so mild that everything else overpowered the flavor.I also thought the toppings (tried all of 'em) didn't really add anything special flavor-wise,  whereas the sauces that they offer for the french fries are much more interesting and complex.I wouldn't mind coming back because I thought the fries were outstanding. Unfortunately I couldn't drink at the time (womp, pregnantladyproblems) but I could definitely see myself coming back for beers and frites in the future. It's a bit out of my way though and the parking is definitely a pain so I think I would sooner check out the other location than come back to this one...although, this location is nice since the Pie Hole is directly across the street!"},{"date":"2016-01-31","rating":"4.0","review":"I absolutely love Wurstkuche. As a vegetarian, I was floored when there was not one, but three, vegetarian sausage options! How does a gal choose? I decided on the Vegetarian Italian dog, which was fantastic. My friends and I shared two groot Belgian fries with the chipotle aioli, sweet and sassy bbq, pesto mayo and chipotle ketchup sauces. All were good, however, the real standout at Wurstkuche is the mustard selection! I am a big fan of mustard and this is pretty much the holy grail. The fries themselves are also topnotch. In addition, Wurstkuche has a fabulous international beer selection. My only complaint is that the the place can be a bit on the loud side. However, I will definitely be back.

I'm not the biggest fan of hotdogs but that was before I got a Wurstkuche sausage. Came with friends on a Friday night and ordered a mozzarella and sundried tomatoes sausage covered with a healthy heaping of caramelized onions and sweet peppers.  I didn't put any sauces atop because it had enough flavor already. I shared the alcoholic apple cider with a friend. The beers come in these huge cups so I guess you know you're getting a bang for your buck. I also ordered the Nesbitt Peach soda. A shocking pink colored drink that tastes like cotton candy. Definitely a recommend. Anyways, what I really love about Wurstkuche is the fries. Beer dipped fried fries. Huge cuts of it with a variety of sauces. Even the small size is enough to really fill you up. I got the chipotle aioli which is slightly spicy. Sometimes there's a DJ playing but even when there's not, music choices still good.

Or whatever your pleasure... The problem I do have, is of course, the cost of said deliciousness! So after $30 in the hole, I had to ask myself if it was really THAT good. And well,....not really.

We regular Brats Brothers in Sherman Oaks. This place trumps any brat I've ever had. Great location in the Arts District in Downtown. (Right across from Angel City Brewery) We walked in at 730ish pm on a Thursday. A woman handed us a menu and there was about 3 people in front of us. We quickly decided we wanted to do exotic brats. We couldn't agree on two, so we got three to share. :) We picked rattlesnake & rabbit, duck & bacon, and pheasant. We also got some truffle fries. I got a liter of Vitus (7.7%) and DELICIOUS, he got a Chimay White (8%) and later a Hopfen-Weiss (8.2%). When you order the liters of beer they hold your credit card, so be sure to bring back the mug to close out. The seating in the back was pretty packed, we found the only empty table, so I guess we got lucky. The food was brought to us in less than 10 minutes. The pheasant was both of our favorites, followed by the duck, and lastly the rabbit and rattlesnake. The pheasant was just so packed with flavor and juices, I can see myself travelling for this meal often.

In line we waited probably around 10 mins and for food around the same 10-15 mins. When we were leaving a bit before 9pm it was even longer the line and the sitting area was definitely popping. Someone had reserved a more enclosed area for a birthday surprise so it looks like you can hold private events. It certainly did feel like I was walking into a club since they had a live DJ at the center and the lights are dimmed. The seating is cafeteria style, you have the option to pick wherever you want to sit. Coming from NYC I'm not use to this style of procedure where you first order then they bring out your food based on your number but it works. They had extra condiments laid out on the table all kind of mustard and ketchup. We ordered the Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapeño peppers (buttery & juice) and Rabbit and Pork with Leeks and Carrots (clean and light). You also get to add two toppings I chose sweet peppers and caramelized onions since I can handle spice and I wasn't sure how spicy their spicy peppers can get. The sausage was good and decent size. Mine didn't feel heavy like after eating Nathans. We got a large Belgian fries to share and chose two sauces: Chipotle Aioli (highly recommended) and Buttermilk Ranch (taste is lighter).If you are looking for a casual night out I would recommend coming here, they also have patio sitting as well. When we were leaving the bus boys were very attentive so tables open up before you know.

Wurstkuche has one of the best hot dogs in Los Angeles. Sure they can't beat the hot dog lady bacon wrap hot dogs but the ingredients they use to make their babies are exotic and amazing. When you walk in it's like walking into a warehouse. They accept cash and credit. When you stand in line somebody usually hands you a menu and ask if you want to drink. After, you order you get your number. Don't worry about seating because if you walk down the dark hallway and open the left door you be transported to their bar/eating area. On the weekends they have a dj mixing some tunes.

This is not too spicy and I like how savory the duck and bacon hotdog is.Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapeno Peppers- I never knew how tasty rattlesnake and rabbit are! I ask the cashier and she said this is one of the most popular picks. Super tasty and I think everyone who comes here should get this!Belgian fries- I usually get the large one to share and it comes with 2 sauces.

Then, I went here a couple of times and the excitement died down. Don't get me wrong- the sausages are delicious and there is definitely novelty involved. How many places actually sell sausages that use rattlesnake for meat?! Yet after I tried all the different types of sausages throughout the year, I did not feel as if I \"yearned\" for this place.I'm not giving this place the full 5-stars because I wouldn't necessarily drive all the way from OC to LA just for this. If I'm in the area and I can't think of anywhere to go, I may just come and dine here but it doesn't necessarily mean I'm an all-time fan. The low-down on my foods:- Pheasant sausage - 4 stars - It's pretty good. You definitely can taste the herbs that were made with the sausage.- Fries - 3 stars. If you get them plain (like I did), you've made a mistake. Make sure you tell them to put truffle oil on top! Also if you get small, you only get one dipping sauce while if you order a large you get two dipping sauces.Also beware - parking on the weekends is definitely hard as it is mostly street parking.

You walk in to a small wait-in-line-to-order lounge where a staff member hands you a two-sided paper menu (food/drinks) and asks you if you want something to drink. PERFECT. You grab a nice cold one as you gaze into the glass case holding the many different creations of sausages. You pay at the counter and they give you a stand-up, metal, red number sign. When you're done paying you walk down a hallway to the main dining area that is park-style; in other words you are eating on wood benches. There is additional elevated seating and a bar where you can continue to order drinks. I have not purchased anything other than beer to drink because sausages and beer go together just so wonderfully. Wurstküche provides its patrons with a steel water dispenser and glass cups to calm the buzz. Wurstküche also provides its patrons with a great ambiance -- friendly people, great music, and delicious food.THE FOOD:The selections are as follows:(1) Sun Dried Tomato & Mozzarella $7 - Smoked chicken and turkey(2) Austin Blues $7 - Hot, spicy, tri-pepper and hardwood-smoked pork(3) Mango Jalapeño $7 - Chicken and turkey(4) Chicken, Apple, & Spices $7 - Two chicken and apple sausages with a speck of cinnamon (pork-free)(5) Vegetarian Italian $6 - Fennel, garlic, red peppers, and eggplant(6) Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle $6 - Chipotle, arbol chilies, garlic, and onions(7) Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sage $6 - Apples, Yukon potatoes, and rubbed sage(8) Hot Italian $6 - Fine cuts of organic GMO-free pork and spices(9) Bockwurst $6 - Veal, pork, and spices(10) Santa Fe Jack Cheese & Jalapeño Peppers *** (Might be discontinued)(11) Louisiana Hot Link $7 - Beef and pork with onions and hot spices(12) Kielbasa $7 - Polish-style pork and beef with onions and spices(13) Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers $8 - Buttery and mildly spicy(14) Duck and Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers $8 - Succulent and packed with flavor(15) Rabbit, Veal, & Pork $8 - A light and delicate sausage seasoned with white wine(16) Filipino Maharlika $7 - Sweet pork with natural seasonings(17) Buffalo, Beef, & Pork with Chipotle Peppers $8 - Smoky chipotle flavor(18) Bratwurst $6 - Fine cuts of pork with coriander and nutmeg(19) Lamb with Mediterranean Spices $8 - Two flavorful and completely pork-free sausagesWhen you order a sausage it comes with a roll and your choice of two (2) toppings from a choice of caramelized onions, sweet peppers, spicy peppers and sauerkraut. I have tried a good amount of the sausages here. I don't like strong spicy foods and for me the Austin Blues, Mango Jalapeño, and Louisiana Hot Link were way spicy for me. My top pick so far is the Buffalo, Beef, & Pork with Chipotle Peppers. Just wow! It is so flavorful, juicy, and it has a small spicy kick, which I enjoyed. The fries are pretty good here - big, thick, and double-dipped they say. The fries come in a small size (Klein $3.50) or a large size (Groot $5.50) and with dipping sauces. One (1) sauce for the Klein and two (2) sauces for the Groot. Each extra sauce is 50 cents. I would recommend getting two (2) sides of the Chipotle Aioli. It is fantastic. Your dining bench has bottles of ketchup and different types of mustard that you can enjoy as well. For dessert, Wurstküche offers a Toasted Apple Pie Ice Cream Sandwich on oatmeal raisin cookies. I have never tried the dessert because I don't like apples and bread together. THE TIPS:There is now a parking lot next to a church right across the street where you pay a max of $10.00. It is worth it because looking for parking in this area is frustrating and tiresome. Once you are done dining here, burn some calories by walking down the street to Angel City Brewery where you can regain what you just burned but won't regret it."},{"date":"2014-09-11","rating":"4.0","review":"My two cents: It's good, but not worth waiting in line for 30 minutes to order good. I've been here a few times and it doesn't matter what night of the week it is, the line will spill out onto the street. This is because Wurstkuche is a hipster establishment, coupled with the fact that they only have one guy taking orders. They really need to get a second register going to take orders in a more timely fashion so the hipsters can get their hipster sausages faster. But then again, perhaps the winding line builds the suspense and hype.I love the sausages here. They're all good. Nice sear, good selection of toppings, freshly baked buns. My favorite is the mango jalapeno, but the duck and bacon and rattlesnake are also delicious for the more adventuresome palate. They even have vegetarian options! Priced at $6.50-$8.00, I think it's fair for a trendy place like this. Overall, lots of (deserved) hype, great selection of beer, sucky parking (the lot is $10 or pray to the parking gods for street parking), long lines and a loud messhall-like dining area. Tips: Must order food at the counter, but can order drinks at the counter or at the bar in the dining hall. Go to the Pie Hole across the street for dessert!"},{"date":"2015-05-10","rating":"5.0","review":"AMAZING ..

The bratwurst and the bockwurst are both very good. The line does tend to get long though but there are servers in there asking ppl what drinks they want while they're waiting - which is pretty neat.

The guy who took our order was nothing but patient and friendly (not sure how much this differs when they are busy).  This place is self-serve and self-seating. It looks like a large warehouse that got converted into a hipster restaurant. Love the ambiance and décor of this place--such a fan of the rustic look. The food was okay, got the chicken which seemed the most normal to me but still didn't blow it out of the water for me.By the time we left, the line was literally outside, circling the building, so coming at a good time is probably a good idea.

Creative twist on a German bier haus with a decidedly modern slant. Decent selection of classic/traditional hot dogs in addition to gourmet ones and exotic ones.Boyfriend had the beef+buffalo+chipotle hotdog and I had the duck+bacon ones. Both were very tasty. You can add two of the following on your hotdog: sweet peppers, spicy peppers, caramelized onions, and/or sauerkraut.Condiments include a wide variety of mustards and also ketchup.Suggestions: buns could use some work, and they can consider serving local craft beers (and not just German or Belgian beers).We came at 5 ish or so - no line at all.

How are there not more of these places around?A friend of mine dragged me over to this little place while we were downtown for a competition. And, now I can't wait to go back.The only negative part of my experience was the parking, but I'm not going to hold that against the place. It is an issue in every gentrified neighborhood in town.When you first get there, you stand in line to order. There are many different types of homemade sausages for you to choose from and all of the different toppings are available upon request. The beers are European and all have their own signature glasses.The sodas are artisanal and eclectic choices. I actually ordered a soda because I was the driver and was not disappointed by the two choices I made. I did get the try the beer though, and I was sad that I couldn't partake.The dining experience is interesting and cool. You order your food and then go back to a dining area where you sit at picnic tables with many different people. It was perfect for us because we had a large group and this style of seat was very accommodating. They will bring the food to you and the condiments are located either edge of the table where you may have to ask a stranger to pass one of the myriad mustards available. I ordered the kielbasa with ground mustard and sauerkraut. It was so juicy and flavorful that you could tell this was not processed. The roll was soft with a nice crust so that the juices didn't make the sandwich fall apart. The sauerkraut  had lots of flavor but was not overly sour to drowned out the flavor of the sausage. The order of fries were really good, especially with the dipping sauces that we ordered. I ordered one of the flavored ketchups and the basil mayo. I don't know how I lived without having flavored condiments before or since.I can't wait to go back and try the different sausages offered by this place. The bratwurst and the Italian sausages looked  crafted with care and pride.

Outside along the side of the building, there's a narrow doorway with a line of people coming out of it; that's the entrance. As you enter, you will find the cashier. You order your food and initial drinks at the cashier. If you notice on other people's pictures on Yelp, there's a glass case that displays the sausages, uncooked, they have for your reference. I appreciate this. I've tried several sausages: Bratwurst, Chicken Apple & Spices, and Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Spices. My favorite has to be the Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Spices. The texture is firm and the flavor has a kick.After you order, you go down a really dark hallway into the eating area. The eating area has plenty of picnic tables, is spacious, and has a bar. You can order more of your drinks there. There's also outdoor seating. Experiment with the beer menu. I can't recommend one because I can never pronounce any of the names, but I've never been disappointed. The employees are very friendly, so ask for recommendations. This place is family-friendly.

At this visit, both myself and a friend decided to eat here after shopping a sample sale. When we walked in, there was a bit of a line, but one of the employees was super friendly and explained the menu to us and helped us to choose what we wanted. Both of us decided on the Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno sausage with Sauerkraut and caramelized onions on top. We also added a large order of fries and the Chipotle Aioli and Bleu Cheese, Walnut & Bacon dipping sauces. The total for one sausage and fries was almost $15.00.We were super excited when we received our food. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it was extremely overpriced for what it was. The Duck & Bacon had flavor, but we still needed to add Mustard and Ketchup to really give it that extra taste. I'm sure that the quality of the meats is what makes the price higher, but I really was expected to be blown away. Like I said, it was still good, just thought it could have been better.The fries on the other hand. OMMMGGGGG. Sooo delicious and they give you so many!!! The Chipotle Aioli dipping sauce was mouth watering and had just enough kick to it. The Bleu Cheese, Bacon & Walnuts was good as well, but I really was expecting more of a Bleu Cheese flavor. It was pretty mild, but the walnuts added a nice texture. I would come back here to eat fries only... Seriously...Overall, this is still a cool place to come and eat and hang out, but I wouldn't make it a frequent thing based on the price. The Service was great and I would absolutely still be interested in another visit to try another type of sausage.Side Notes: I am not a fan of beer, so I really can't say anything about their quality/selection.

I could see it being a nightmare though, since there's mainly a large picnic table in the middle of the room. The dog (topped with whole mustard), the fries, and the curry ketchup were just okay. Although my fiance liked it, I thought it wasn't anything really special. I would come back and give it another try, since people seem to be raving about this place..."},{"date":"2016-02-05","rating":"2.0","review":"next time I'll just stick to the fries and beer. I got food poisoning from the vegetarian hotdog and I'm still recovering."},{"date":"2015-04-06","rating":"4.0","review":"A great casual spot for sausages, beer, and fries. You can usually find street parking nearby.Wurstkuche has a great vibe. You order at the front, then head down a little corridor to the back section where the seating is. Seating consists of a lot of long, communal benches as well as some side tables. The overall feel is dive-y, casual, and perfect for groups. When ordering, you get the option of 2 out of 4 toppings for your brat: caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers (bell peppers), and spicy peppers.SAUSAGES:My favorite of the ones I've tried so far is the Buffalo, Beef, and Pork w/Chipotle Peppers. It has a medium-heat, smokey spiciness and bold flavor. The Duck and Bacon w/Jalapeno Peppers is a close second, with a slightly more fatty taste. I've tried the Rattlesnake and Rabbit w/Jalapeno before and it just didn't stand out to me. That said, I think you're perfectly fine going with Classics ($6) or Gourmets ($7) rather than the pricier Exotics. They do well in spicing their sausages, and thus the spices stand out more than the actual meat. I have a couple vegetarian friends who rave about their vegetarian sausage options. My only complaint is that the sausages are pretty small for what you pay. Without a side order of fries or a beer, you definitely won't be full.BELGIAN FRIES + DIPPING SAUCES:I really think that Wurstkuche shines in their Belgian fries and dipping sauces, not so much their sausages. The small size includes one dipping sauce and is $3.50 and the large includes 2 dipping sauces and is $5.50. The large is good for sharing between 2-3 people, though they're so good you could probably devour an entire order yourself. The fries are thick-cut, always crispy on the outside, and perfect with the truffle glaze (though $2 extra for this is a bit pricey). Get the chipotle aioli dipping sauce! It's creamy and smokey and I can't get enough of it. Curry ketchup is another good option.I love Wurstkuche for its laid-back vibe and simple, tasty menu options. Go for the sausages, stay for the fries!"},{"date":"2015-09-24","rating":"4.0","review":"Came here 2 weeks ago and had a decent experience. I tried the Mango & Jalapeno, which was decent with a rubbery texture. I wouldn't have minded the texture if the sausage itself had more flavor. To me it tasted like a sweeter sausage with bits of Jalapeno chunks (that weren't spicy at all). Friend got the Rabbit & Rattlesnake Jalapeno, which wasn't bad. It was just the thought of the 2 combined that threw me off... Likeee did the rattlesnake eat the rabbit then they grinded them together??? Lol.The fries were not bad, I added the truffle sauce. I went again last week before the Zedd concert and had a much better experience though. The cashier suggested that I go with the \"Hot Italian\" and it was sooo dam good. It was basically what I expected the Mango &  Jalapeno sausage to taste like. That will definitely be my go to!"},{"date":"2015-04-04","rating":"5.0","review":"You can't go wrong with a brat here.

They have a very wide beer selection, almost in competition with yard house when it comes to beer. I went there today with a friend and I really enjoyed the food and drinks. I had to try the dock and bacon sausage. The combination of having a duck sausage with bacon just sounded phenomenal. I also had the mango sausage.both were absolutely great. Great texture and a very nice crisp.  I really liked the flavor of the bacon duck sausage. The mango was great as well however it had a bit of a Limey or tangy flavor.It's a type of place where you order and they'll bring you your food out to you. The service was pretty quick. It seemed like there was a long line and it took us more time to get our order in. Overall it is a great spot but watch out it's can be pretty pricey.

I wouldn't make a trip just for this all the time, but it was nice to try. The parking is outrageous, almost makes you not want to go- $10 or $7 flat rate (don't let the $2 and $3 lots full you - it means for every 10 mins not flat rate). Not worth it for a sausage hot dog- that's almost as much as one of their sausages. Try to find street parking if you're lucky enough because there are alot of businesses in that area. Heard the fries were pretty good, we tried chipotle aioli and bleu cheese bacon and walnut. The blue cheese, you can literally taste all those flavors and chipotle was good too but how you would imagine it to taste. Both were super creamy (not a huge fan of cream) so the fries tasted good with their ketchup as well. Ketchup is a little sweeter than heinz.We tried rattle snack and rabbit-very good and packed with flavor, tasted more gritty and earthy. Pleathen (spelling)- SUPER HERBY. Really good though, but after awhile tasted like dim sum dumplings. It is pretty pricy for the amount of food given but you will really have to appreciate the quality of the meat and the uniqueness! Yeah costco is cheaper but you're not eating something exotic!"},{"date":"2016-03-23","rating":"5.0","review":"Came here for lunch as our last meal in LA and it didn't disappoint. The mango jalapeño with the onions and hot peppers was a recommendation from the cook and it was awesome. The fries and their chipotle ketchup was amazing!

You'll love the experience!"},{"date":"2015-04-23","rating":"4.0","review":"This place definitely lives up to its name of the \"purveyor of exotic grilled sausages\" Some of their 'exotic' meats include: buffalo, snake, duck, rabbit, lamb, and pheasant I came here with a friend and ordered their rattlesnake & rabbit with jalapeno peppers. It was chewy and tasted pretty good, but I couldn't really tell that I was eating anything special. The bell peppers were a nice touch though. Honestly this place seems a bit overpriced for what they're serving you, but I suppose you're paying for the 'exotic-ness.'  Also, there seemed to be plenty of seating, but be ready to wait in line for a bit especially if you come during peak hours. Lastly, and I've mentioned this before, traffic and parking in downtown LA sucks. It might not be worth it to make the drive all the way to downtown just for this, but if you're in the area then this place is worth a try at least once. You might as well also try the other nearby restaurants and enjoy the art district/little Tokyo while you're at it to make the drive and search for parking worth it."},{"date":"2015-02-24","rating":"5.0","review":"Super hip, really tasty, and extremely dark. (Seriously, can we turn the lights up a bit in the dining room?) There are both exotic hot dogs (rattlesnake duck, rabbit, etc.) and regular hot dogs that are stellar. I am not an average hot dog eater, but I make an exception for Wurst. My advice is try an exotic just to say you did and then find your favorite amongst the regulars. My favorite is the mango jalapeño! Belgian fries are also delicious - get it with the pesto mayo and you won't be disappointed! Dining area is always bustling and usually has a DJ playing jams. Really cool place to get together for an easy bite with friends."},{"date":"2016-03-06","rating":"4.0","review":"Let me start by saying that they have a great beer selection.

The meat choices may be a little exotic but delecious. The rattlesnake and rabid was delicious. We all tried different things and nobody was disappointed."},{"date":"2015-08-30","rating":"3.0","review":"I came here because I saw this place was really popular on yelp. I ordered the lamb with caramelized onions and spicy peppers. I thought the sausage was really average... Maybe it is because I am not a super big fan of hot dogs... But I didn't think there was anything super special about their hot dogs except for the fact that they are made out of different meats, like lamb, rabbit, snake etc. I also ordered s side of fries with truffle oil, dipped in pesto mayo and chipotle aioli.

Again, flavorful but not greasy.Belgian fries were awesome. Chipotle aioli was bomb. Blue cheese walnut and bacon dip was whatevers.We came when it was slow, which was nice. I can see it poppin' at night. I liked the large open space.I feel like beyond the variety in the kinds of dogs, it wasn't anything crazy or mind blowing in terms of flavor. Just lots of mustard selections, which I don't mind since I love mustard but it does feel like an illusion trick to distract people from what their meal is supposed to be.

BUT THEN - the man in the front distributing menus and highlighting all of the fabulous options sucked us in! Im happy he did convince us to give it a try as the food and the atmosphere were interesting/entertaining/delicious! Process includes ordering up front - walking down a long hallway that leads to the dining room (filled with beautiful wood and steel tables/chairs/benches), and awaiting food delivery (relatively fast and very friendly service). Then it's your turn to choose which of the available 5 or 6 sauces you prefer to smother your sausage and fries with (all flavor options are scattered among the tables - various versions of ketchup/mustard/other condiments)! We ordered the curry ketchup to accompany our fries (so good) and topped our bratwurst with mustard and ketchup (the grilled onions and peppers are great additions to any sausage, as well). A seemingly older euro-looking dude in a bright red Lacoste polo was deejaying the background music - watching him drink beer and excitedly choose the new track provided ample entertainment!   A casual, fun, and delicious time for all."},{"date":"2016-01-10","rating":"4.0","review":"Bomb place.

The drive only took about 15 minutes from the heart of Hollywood. There is a lot of metered and some free street parking. There was a small lot nearby offering parking for $2 every 15 minutes. We arrived at 7pm on a Sunday and the seating area was packed but there was only a small line to order. We actually walked in from the wooden door on the street corner into the bar/seating area and were so confused. If you enter from there, walk through the brick hallway and you'll end up in a small room where the register is. Order at the register and take your number to the seating area. There are also take-home sausages available for purchase at the register.Sausages are offered in 3 categories: classic, gourmet, exotic. You are able to choose 2 toppings from: sauerkraut, grilled onions, sweet peppers, hot peppers. I went with the Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapeño, topped with grilled onions and sweet peppers. Some reviews said the sausages were dry but this was super juicy and flavorful. The roll it came on was fresh and warm, and the toppings were nicely cooked. Really really tasty!! 4 types of mustard are offered on the tables, and fries with dipping sauces are also on the menu. I don't like mustard and am not a huge fan of fries so I didn't try either of those. My complaint that almost made me want to take my review down to 3 stars is that I was still hungry after. I just wish the sausage was bigger (lol) but then again I love large portions. The bar menu seemed like it had a very good variety of draft and bottled beers. I liked the rustic atmosphere with the brown paper covering the tables for the messy eaters.

The only thing is finding the place, its littlerally a hole in the wall..lol We mustve came before the dinner rush too, or else it probably wouldve been easier to find. But we waited outside for our friend for about 15 minutes and people started lining up before our eyes and in no time, the line snaked around the inside and wrapped outside along the wall.The line moved quick though, and they let you order drinks (beer) while youre waiting in line. I don't even remember what beer I ordered but I just asked for the strongest one, and it was pretty good lol, it came in a goblet/wine glass thing so I felt extra fancy. lolI guess this place is known for thier exotic susages, so I had to try the rattle snake and rabbit dog, and I got larges fries to go with it with Aoili (SUPERGOOD) and yogurt (eh) dipping sauce. The sausage was really good, but you couldve probably given me any kinda sausge and told me it was a rattle snake and I wouldnt have thought different. Nothing really stood out, but its def worth a try.The dining area is pretty dark though, so if you want a place to converse, I dunno about this place...maybe bring a lantern and some candles to brighten up your tables? lolOverall not bad, just a place to go, to say you tried something crazy lol"},{"date":"2015-02-11","rating":"5.0","review":"As if there aren't already a plethora of awesome eateries in the wonderful Arts District...Wurstküche is definitely up there.

Unfortunately, with no servers, and a wannabe euro club atmosphere Wurstkuche falls very short of the mark.Side note: do you also like the kind of people that wear glasses with no lenses in them? They all come here! Effing hipsters.."},{"date":"2016-02-18","rating":"5.0","review":"It's one of those spots where you order at the counter and they bring it to your table.

Thank you for ruining it for me"},{"date":"2015-01-17","rating":"3.0","review":"I can definitely see why Wurstkuche is such a happening place: the food is inexpensive for the area, great booze selection, and nice open seating. Their staff is really friendly and I love hanging out in the Arts District. However, the food taste-wise, is only okay. Their sausages are quite salty and the meat to bun ratio is ridiculous - too much bread! My favorite thing to get here is their fries!!! Their fries are really tasty and I love their dipping sauce options. Catching up with friends here always sound better in theory than on execution. The noise level is REALLY LOUD and seating can be hard to find during peak hours. Seats aren't the most comfortable and there's occasionally hovering when others are table stalking - making it not the best place to hang out for a long time. I also think they would benefit by having another cashier. The wait to order can be up to 20 min during peak hours and the line spills onto the outside (their ordering area is way too small). Perhaps they can adopt a hybrid \"In-N-Out\" drive-through line style of ordering so the cashier only has to handle payments to speed up the process? Plus your food will arrive faster! In short: for a better time, come on weekdays but come for atmosphere, not the food (except the fries!). Parking: pretty challenging. If you get lucky/show up early enough, there's meter parking (free after a certain time). If not, there are paid lots to tide you over. Better yet: Metro in (gold line)"},{"date":"2015-02-03","rating":"4.0","review":"We came here spur of the moment after the bar in Koreatown offered more expensive food options that we preferred. I've been meaning to come back here for a few years. I am delighted it hasn't changed in service and quality. I was glad I didn't have to wait in a 30+ minute line like the first time I came here as it was 11pm and not too many folks were around. I ordered the Lamb with Mediterranean Spices with spicy peppers and caramelized onions as well as a delicious beer. The sausage was delicious. It reminded me of lamb and harissa. Definitely very Mediterranean-Moroccan vibe going on there. My friend had the buffalo and pork. Not as delicious as mine but definitely had a nice smokiness going for it.There is a nice selection of mustards on the side and took advantage of them. We shared a large order of fries and they were dipped in copious amounts of mustards as well as the pesto mayo and curry ketchup (both delicious by the way).I'll be back once I go through all the other bookmarks I have on Yelp."},{"date":"2015-10-13","rating":"4.0","review":"I like me some hot dogs!This place is delicious.

Not that I have a problem with it, but I'm from San Diego, and used to drinking IPA or IIPA, so I'm kinda out of my elements here.Anyway, I end up having St. Feuillien and some sort of fruity drinks that are too sweet for my taste. Should've asked for a sample, but the bar was pretty hectic that night, so I just want to get my beer and got to a table. My St. Feuillien came in a 0.25-L glass which is gorgeous! As a matter of fact, my three beers came in different glasswares, so I give them credit for presentation there.Wanted to get food a couple times here, but the line is just insane!! The atmosphere is a bit too dark for my liking, and the bar is rather plain when it comes to decoration. There's no harm really of putting some hipster decor or something, but oh well, they're making good money, so I guess they don't have to worry about it.Will probably go back for the food because I really want to try those hyped sausages!"},{"date":"2015-07-14","rating":"5.0","review":"I forgot how tasty Wurstkuche is!!

I wondered if we should go to the bar, or would someone come up to take our order.  I saw someone who looked like they worked here, and she informed me we were in the dining area and that we needed to order at the front.  Apparently we had entered through the back door and in the process let it be known that it was our first time here.  The woman was very friendly and walked us to the front ordering area before running us through the menu and giving us recommendations.  There was a little bit of a line, so we had a good chance to go over the menu and figure out what we wanted.  I went with the Mango Jalapeño chicken-sausage and split a large order of fries.  I also ordered a Vitus, which is my favorite beer that I don't come across often.   My Mango Jalapeño chicken-sausage and fries were pretty good, but nothing special.  What stuck out most about my meal was how little the sausage was, and that I was still hungry afterwards. What really made my meal good though was being able to wash it down with a cold Vitus.Wurstkuche was pretty good.  I was expecting more because of all the things that I had heard about it, and maybe I held the place to too high of a standard.  It is not a place I would go to if I was super hungry, but I would come back for a small meal and a good beer. It was worthy of a visit and possibly a return trip.3.5 stars rounded up to 4"},{"date":"2016-01-20","rating":"5.0","review":"This spot is seriously AMAZING!!

A delicious vegetarian sausage is very difficult to come by. I almost want to think that it is non-existent and that my search will go on forever! I had the Mexican Chipotle Sausage w/ caramelized onions and spicy peppers. It was yummy, definitely better than most I've had prior to Wurstkuche. The sausage was flavorful enough that I didn't need anything else on it. The bread was good, it was a little on the tough side for me. I like their mustard selection and their fries get two thumbs up! Their service was on point! The staff were super friendly and carried a conversation very well! Customer service can be lost with food joints that are popular and super busy. I really enjoyed my experience due to the staff. The aesthetics of the place is wood grain and metal, which is always a favorite of mine. The main dinning room is a bit too dim for my taste, especially in the dark winter nights in DTLA.

From classic sausages like veal and pork to gourmet renditions of rattle snake and rabbit. Beer on tap, fries, mustard, and everything you need for a great evening with friends. Depending on where you enter the restaurant from it almost takes on two separate identities. From the one side, you got a long bar with plenty of seats, communal tables, and even an outdoor patio. From the other, a Dali style walk up with a glass refrigerator displaying all the tubular meats your heart desires. An open grill and a few taps behind the cash register. Of course both sides are intertwined, so regardless where you're coming from you'll find the need to navigate this mini maze. But hey, that's part of the fun. My order was prepared really quickly and brought to the table according to my number. The sausage was nicely made and had great flavor with the kind of texture you expect from veal. The dominant notes of coriander and caraway rounded out the taste. I would say that my favorite part is the simplicity of toppings. Just a few to choose from and all will only compliment your selection, not detract from it. So grab a wiener, chug a beer, and enjoy!"},{"date":"2015-06-09","rating":"4.0","review":"The Louisiana hot link is my favorite. I also loved the sweet peppers and caramelized onions.

If you happen to enter through the back (corner entrance) and only see the bar and tables, head toward the back down a small hallway.

It's an order at the counter and have your sausage brought out to you sort of place. And, it boasts a wide variety of sausage and beer options (including vegetarian and rattlesnake), so it's kinda cool. And, the seating area is cool--adult picnic tables with a choice of mustards and ketchup. But, for me, I wasn't overly impressed. I did get the veggie (the Italian one), and there's only so much you can do to vegetarian ingredients to make them \"meaty\", but I found it to have WAY too much oregano or some other Italian seasoning. The first bite was good, but after that it was quite overwhelming. Thankfully my co-eater shared his fries, which were actually pretty amazing--thick cut and yet somewhat crispy and tasting truly wholesome (as potatoes go)--4.5 stars. Bottom line: If this is your kind of food, you'll love it. Just be prepared for the hipster price tag. Hipsters are no longer starving artists living in SoHo and writing poetry with Allen Ginsberg; they are the offbeat yuppie with disposable income for fancy beer and sausage served at indoor picnic tables."},{"date":"2015-08-01","rating":"2.0","review":"The food is tasty. The beer is good. The customer service is horrible. We came with a group of people and the bartender acted on race and prejudice and tried to refuse to serve one of my friends alcohol. Her reasoning was that he'd had enough. We literally just placed our order, sat down and ordered drinks. He had nothing to drink and the fact that we had to prove it was ridiculous.

It was delicious, although there wasn't an overwhelmingly noticeable flavor of duck, or bacon but rather an overall delicious flavor that included the bun and the toppings. It was pretty filling, and the sausages were fairly priced as compared to similar restaurants. I was impressed by the beer selection but even more impressed by the fact that they attempt to give you the perfect glass for every beer, whether it be by shape, or label or both.

The bearded guy was really friendly & accommodating, helping you to maneuveur & order with food & drink.  Then the cashier tallies the order, you pay. They give you a metal numbered tag to place on the table you found to plant your behind. A runner finds your number & gives you the order.  I ordered the duck & bacon wuerst, & a friend ordered the rattlesnake & rabbit with Sauerkraut, pickled jalapenos.  The duck was cooked rather well-done & the meat texture was hard. I could barely sense the bacon. There was not even a slight gamy, wild taste of duck.The rattlesnake & rabbit was more delicately cooked to a medium so the texture was more moist, meaty.  However, the meat could be almost any meat since there was no real discernable taste difference.  The spicing was more of a factor in the light flavour than the meat itself.  This combination of meat is misleading since it could be a separate mixture of rabbit & rattlesnake, but it could also be rattlesnake that had eaten a rabbit.  In which case, the rabbit would just be an after thought.  The bearded, friendly wolverine/bear guy suggested a cucumber drink or the Elderflower drink to pair with the Rattle snake & Rabbit as well as the Duck & bacon.  The elderberry is like a bubble up with a slightly creamy feel.  You saunter through a long hallway with restroom conveniently along the way which opens up to a huge space with picnic-like HARD wooden table guaranteed to hurt your rear-end if you sit too long.  There is also a sizable private room offset from the mess hall.    This is not earth-shaking food that will change your life.  It's more like comfort food indirectly via some imaginary Hofbraeuhaus, Muenchen, Deutschland.  3- Yelp stars.  Guten Appetit und Prosit!"},{"date":"2016-03-05","rating":"5.0","review":"Love this place.

The acoustics for the dining area is not optimal, but hey the cafeteria style tables are hipster chic. If you're not imbibing beer, the cucumber flavored water is a refreshing option. The classic bratwurst is what I usually go for since it's on their cheaper end and just as tasty as their other exotic options.

After perusing the menu, my friend and I decided on the mango jalapeño hot dog with caramelized onions and spicy peppers and the Louisiana hot link with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. I preferred the mango jalapeño because it was sweet, but not too sweet, with some heat. The Louisiana hot link was okay but I didn't really think it had a flavor. It just tastes hot. The sweet/spicy peppers are also not particularly sweet/spicy. The sweet peppers are just a combination of sautéed yellow and red bell peppers and the spicy are just sautéed green bell peppers. The fries are also BOMB. They're double fried like Korean fried chicken so they're uber crispy on the outside and super fluffy, almost creamy, on the inside. Paired with the Chipotle Ketchup, they were oh so satisfying. I definitely want to come back to eat fries and try all the different sauces.The reason why Wurstküche isn't getting 5 stars for me are two reasons:01. the beer02. the atmosphereThey have a wide selection of great sounding beers. My friend and I ordered an Apple Ale because I thought it just sounded refreshing against the greasiness of the hot dog. Isn't that good, Justin? Why yes it is random stranger reading my review. They are good but there is just so much foam on top. My ale was poured into a pilsner glass so pouring it with minimal foam should be pretty easy but a good inch or two was just foam. Whoever's pouring these has got to take some lessons or visit a college party or something. I saw other people ordering beers in line and it was pretty severe for everyone's. I felt bad for this one dude whose beer came in a goblet. Literally half was just foam. He finished it before it was his turn to order and he bought another one. I guess the atmosphere could be a pro or con depending on how you looked at it. It was LOUD. There was a DJ and progressively, it seemed as if the music was just getting louder and louder. My friend and I were already yelling at each other just to hear and mid-meal we just gave up and ate in music-raped silence. It was just kind of odd because the decor was very urban chic with lots of wood and metal so the club music just seemed out of place. Literally, all they need are lights and you've got a nightclub.Also, if you end up sitting at the communal rows of picnic benches, grabbing sauces is kind of awkward because there's only a few of each for a bunch of parties you most likely don't know. However, the hot dog was definitely juicy and flavorful enough that the mustards and ketchup take away more than they add. The bench seating kind of makes it harder for larger groups to find seating though."},{"date":"2015-07-07","rating":"5.0","review":"Great atmosphere where you are forced to share the German style long wooden tables.  When forced to share space, it always helps to have delicious beer and brats on hand.  Which they have in spades.  Be adventurous.  Try the rattlesnake sausage and wash it down with a Wiesenstephaner.  Or a Bitburger.  IF you find the sausages too dry, you haven't been drinking enough bier."},{"date":"2015-05-25","rating":"5.0","review":"Been here several times & I have to say you must try their Belgium fries w/ truffle oil because they are bomb.com w/ a side of chipotle aioli.

I love Belgium beer they have a nice selection of beer. The set up is pretty much like Oktoberfest w/ benches picnic style tables & u sit w/ strangers and start chopping it up.

Let's go over the good..If you'd like to try something different or if you've ever wondered what a duck or rabbit tasted like this is the place to go. If you believe life is too short to drink watered down cheap beer Wurstkuche has a good selection of tasty foreign beer. This place is also decent in price. It's an interesting set up here too. Carry out in one side and bar on the other which I think is convenient. Also dark, not too dark that you trip over stuff though.  OK, now the bad. Well there's not much I have to say negatively about this place but that you'll probably spend some amount of time waiting. It's pretty popular and can sometimes get crowded. If you go on the weekends just count on it being crowded. People aren't kidding about this place being full of hipsters. Beware of fedora douches. Doesn't stop me from coming though."},{"date":"2014-03-27","rating":"4.0","review":"Don't be fooled by the long line constantly outside of Wurstkuche - this place is clearly set up in a way to always have a line out the door.  There's a very small room to place your order from but when you get your #, you take it to a HUGE back room with lots of seating (mostly communal) and a large bar at the back.  They do take beer orders in line to make the wait time a little more bearable, but the wait really isn't bad at all since most people study the menu while in line and get up to the cashier knowing exactly what they want.I had the caramelized onions and spicy peppers on the mango jalapeno chicken sausage, and split and order of fries with my bf.  The fries were thick and great... but not for people who like those skinny McDonald's type fries) and perfect for dipping in sauces (which they offer for .75 each) although I personally prefer just normal ketchup.There's different bottles of mustard around that you can grab to each with your sausage, but I found that mine didn't need anything extra.I was skeptical of this whole idea, since I'm not usually a fan of bratwurst or of German food (especially as a non red meat eater), but the gourmet options gave me a lot of things to choose from.  AMAZING beer menu... my bf is a total beer snob and even he was impressed. He said that a lot of the beer that they serve here you can't even buy in the US. I tried an apple and strawberry beer, both which tasted kind of like juice, which was a major win for me since I'm not a big beer drinker. What gets expensive here is not the food but all of the beer that you have to go along with it.  Seriously, why are people complaining that a $6 to $8 sausage is too expensive if it's your DINNER?  We spent maybe $25 on food here for two people (cheap for dinner!) but about $50 on beer (not so cheap but totally in our control).Not an every day, or every month kind of place... but definitely a \"I'm in the mood for some gluttony\" kind of place."},{"date":"2015-06-02","rating":"4.0","review":"Centrally located in the beautiful LA arts district alongside with other wonderful establishments nearby! This was my second time at Wurstkuche however my first time at this particular location. Gets crowded on a Saturday night so get in line early before it keeps piling on! Be aware that they do not condone cutters at all so don't cut in line! Besides, the line moves along fairly fast :P I ordered the buffalo, beef, & pork with chipotle peppers (we got this recommendation from a staff member who said it was his favorite). I added on my personal favorite toppings: caramelized onions and spicy peppers which you're allowed to pick from a list. The meat was very delicious and bursting with flavor. You can also add/try 6 different sauces which are available in bottles kind of scatter around the tables. We were lucky to sit next to a table with guys that was just there for drinking so they said we could have their bottles. We also got the groot fries which were really delicious and extra crispy. Don't be afraid to try them out with the different sauces as well! The building is very oddly shaped. As soon as you order, you walk down this narrow path which leads you to a bigger room where people eat. Btw, they give you a number after you order and the staff will bring out your order to you as soon as they're ready. There was a DJ and loud music was being played on top of people talking to each other. It just was a bit much for me. Luckily there's outside seating where it was much quieter however the tables are also oddly shaped and small so it wasn't ideal for big groups at all as it could get very cramped if you have a lot of orders sitting on the table. Overall I would come back just because I love the area and you could seriously hit all the establishments when you're there (dessert, beer, bar, etc). That's a whole itinerary just for one area so capitalize on that!Note: Parking can be hell. There's street parking only or those private lots where you can pay $10 for instance for the whole night. It's definitely not worth it to me to circle around that much. But read the signs carefully because some will say $5 and in really itty bitty writing, it'll say each 15 minutes.

They even threw in the statement that there were over 6,000 good Yelp reviews. It was very close so how could I pass it up?  I ordered the Hot Italian with grilled onions and bell peppers. In addition, I picked up a side of fries. Basically the hotdog or sausage dog was really good! The casing was nice and crispy. It had a crunch in every bite. The bell peppers and onions complimented the hotdog well. The fries are pretty killer too. The fries are different. I'm not sure how to describe them, but it's something worth trying out. The bottom line is this place is a winner! It is a little on the pricey side if you're a struggling artist or student.  For a sausage dog, fries, and a drink you'd be looking at spending about $13.

Of course we liked them and if you choose your toppings wisely you can have some very wild or complementary flavors.  For example, sauerkraut and brautwurst - how can you even go wrong?  But sauerkraut on a sweet sausage prob won't go well IMO.  The fries were not greasy at all which was surprising as they were super crispy yet soft in the middle.  Pluses for having Greek yogurt sauce.  I think with their bottled drinks like ginger ale or a craft beer, this meal can get pricey.  Keep in mind they have water in the back of the dining room if you want to keep you bill down. We went early and didn't deal with crowds, but when you get here late I assume their communal tables get packed and there is a lot of passing around of the mustard containers that are on the tables.The service in this place is one of the friendliest and everyone from the girl at the register to the table bussers were all very nice and helpful!  I think that their staff is a large part of why Wurstkuche is so well-liked and popular in LA.  Great food find!"},{"date":"2016-04-23","rating":"4.0","review":"This place almost always has a long line!

It's like two blocks away but parking prices are much more steep.When I first tried Wurstkuche, I thought to myself, \"This is how Brats Bros in Sherman Oaks should taste like!\" Yeah, I'm still bitter about that poor experience. Guy Fieri even vouched for Brat Bros. I learned to not follow him as much after that. I have to admit, the rattlesnake and rabbit was disappointing. It sounded really crazy but tasted like chicken and was kind of flavorless. However, the duck and bacon was more flavorful and juicy! I have also tried the mango and jalapeno and that has to be my favorite so far. Juicy and flavorful. I'd like it for to be spicier though. I have been wanting to try the alligator but they haven't had it in months. When I went again recently, it was completely off the menu! The truffle fries are okay. I'm not a fan of waffle fries but the chipotle aioli that I got with it complemented it well. Speaking of condiments, I like how a bunch of condiments are available on your table. They add slight subtleties to your sausages. The water taste a little funky here. There are cups for you to get it on your own. So skip the water and instead go for some beer or vintage soda.

Wurstküche isn't as much German as it is a creator of franken-sausages. The sausages are divided into three categories: classic, gourmet, and the exotics. You then get a choice of two toppings, which includes caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, or spicy peppers. Why drive a Honda when you can drive a Lamborghini? Of course you're going to go for the exotics. In reality, you're actually driving a Lamborghini with a Honda engine. I tried the popular rattlesnake & rabbit with jalapeno peppers. There was nothing actually special about the sausage itself. There was no distinctive rattlesnake flavor that stood out. In essence, I had paid $7.50 for a showboat hotdog. While the sausage itself was pretty juicy, the plain, bland baked roll was unappetizing. I also tried a bite of the Filipino marharlika, which was sweet pork with natural seasonings. It didn't taste much different from the rattlesnake & rabbit. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the Belgian fries. A small includes one dipping sauce, while a large includes two. I tried the curry ketchup, which was strangely addicting. Apparently, the wait can get long, but it wasn't too bad on a Sunday evening. It was convenient to order and then find a spot out on the patio. Communal seating inside can be a little tougher to snag. Wurstküche is worth a try only if you're in the area and already have parking; otherwise, move along because there's nothing much to taste here."},{"date":"2015-07-11","rating":"4.0","review":"This place is pretty great. Their fries and sauces are where it's at! I recommend the curry ketchup! They also have a great beer selection. Oh and of course the sausages/brats. I'd be tempted to give 5 stars (or at least 4.5 if Yelp allowed half stars), but the restroom was not great--the cleanliness was questionable, but also the amenities were less than great. For instance, they have a short faucet--short faucets are the worst. It makes it hard to wash one's hands without touching the sick itself, which is not OK, especially for public restrooms."},{"date":"2015-12-27","rating":"3.0","review":"A bit salty for me but nonetheless still an exotic try for eating rabbit, rattlesnake, and duck with bacon. First time there in the evening when the ambiance is completely different. It's more of a hangout spot where you can meet up with friends and chill out to the music there. They have a live DJ at night and the music is pretty awesome. I'd go back and grab one of their fine beers next time."},{"date":"2016-01-23","rating":"2.0","review":"Well Im a little disappointed.

We got our sausages and beers, and while eating, a woman at the next table came up to us, said that she was on a date with a man who felt dangerous and who had taken her phone, and asked us to call her a cab. We obviously called her a cab right away, and walked her outside to wait for it. While walking out, the men she was with followed us out, and basically wouldn't let her leave the bar. It was really fucking creepy. One of my friends tried to simply get in between the man and this woman who had asked her for help, standing between them. At this point, the restaurant staff started yelling at my *friend,* telling her to get away from the creep who was bothering the woman who had come up to us. The dude was seriously a CREEP. We tried to explain to the staff what had happened.  and not only did they refuse to listen to us, they proceeded to get security to ask us to leave. We asked them again and again to just listen to the story of the woman coming up to us to ask for help, and they told us that the only \"problem\" they saw was our friend putting herself between the creep and the woman who asked us for help. We asked them if they would at least keep an eye on the situation, and they literally said, \"She's drunk, and those guys seem fine.\"As anyone reading this knows, it is a rare thing to have a stranger approach you and ask for help because of a dangerous situation. I have never been at a bar where a woman came up to me and asked to be put in a cab because her companion was dangerous. Even if it wasn't \"really\" an emergency, if someone is going to walk up to a total stranger and ask them to call them a cab for her, it's a situation worth taking very seriously. While we understood that the staff could not necessarily do anything about it, the way the staff kept ignoring the testimony of three people-- 3 women, incidentally-- and privileging the deeply fucking creepy testimony of 2 random men, was a nightmare to see. It wasn't *just* that they wouldn't believe us, it was that they also had us kicked out for \"starting problems.\" When we expressed concern about the safety of the woman who came up to us, they told us, repeatedly, \"she's drunk.\" One barback went so far to listen in and then toss over his shoulder at us, \"Not all guys are like that.\" Yeah, not all guys *are* like that. The staff at the Wurstkuche, however, *are*. Ultimately, me and my two friends were asked to leave the bar, and we went home not knowing if the woman who asked us for help was okay. We took the cab she had asked us to call for her. As we know, we live in a culture where more than 2/3 of women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetimes. We need to live with that reality in our minds and constantly work on acting differently in moments like the one I describe above. Again, while the Wurstkuche staff could not necessarily *do* anything about the situation, their response was disgusting, misogynist, and dangerous. Even if everyone involved was drunk-- and it was midnight at a BAR-- that's not an excuse to ignore a situation that someone has reported as dangerous. Furthermore, the way that the staff refused to listen to 4 women-- my two friends, me, and the woman reporting danger-- over the voices of 2 fucking creepy men was egregious, and such bald testimony to the fact that this is not a place where women can hang out. My review, in short, for my sisters: Don't go to Wurstkuche, don't spend your money there, don't drink there, don't take your friends there, don't spend your time there. This place is run by misogynist assholes, and we live in an enormous, amazing city with great food and drink, and millions of other places that don't actively invest in date rape culture to frequent. Stay away!"},{"date":"2014-10-13","rating":"3.0","review":"I'm sure some will feel I'm being hard on Wurstküche for rating them 3 stars, but I have a Yelputation for being a straight shooter. I only give 4 for things that really rise to the occasion, and the competition can be stiff. They absolutely nailed it as far as my Franziskaner beer goes. Along with their magnificent Belgian Fries, lengthy hours (open til 1:30a every day), location, and cool atmosphere that includes a DJ whipping out some beats, I should be a big time fan. But, I'm not going to beat around the büsh. This might be hard to swallow, but I must bring up that I've never been much of a sausage guy. It's nothing to start an uprising over though, so when I made plans to meet up with some friends in The Arts District and they wanted to check out Wurstküche, I sucked it up and went along for the ride, instead of pulling out.After being granted entry and grabbing a menu, I glanced at their extensive options but nothing immediately popped out. There was a Hot Italian and a Vegetarian Mexican, but I had to take my eyes off the other patrons and decide what to order. They say \"Everything is Bigger in Texas\" so I got the Austin Blues ($6.50) gourmet sausage with hot peppers and caramelized onions. The Austin Blues was actually of average size, although the toppings were plentiful to the point I couldn't see the sausage under them. I could've easily downed 2, but wasn't interested in double fisting. Maybe they should look into offering enlargements instead. The menu describes the Austin Blues as \"hot and spicy, tri-pepper and hardwood smoked pork.\" Now, I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but was a bit let down that it wasn't massively spicy.  After my first bite or 2 I was hoping it'd grow on me, but it never did. At least it came quickly (service was on point, even during the peak on a Friday night). It wasn't messy either."},{"date":"2016-04-17","rating":"1.0","review":"Not a fan. Personally I think Dirt Dog is better than this place. We got the sun dried tomato sausage with truffle oil fries. Not good. I've had real deal truffle fries and was disappointed they were truffle oil fries. They tasted like regular fries with some tasteless oil thrown on it. One girl with short pink hair sprayed more oil on the fries for us which was nice of her to do (and she was the only nice employee), but that didn't help anything. Just an excuse to jack up the price. But besides the food, my sister and I just received dirty looks from all of the white employees like we didn't belong. Not inclusive at all. Like they're not used to seeing black people or have never seen a black person before. The lady at the register acted like she didn't want to take our order and rolled her eyes at us for no reason. Then they kept staring at us like we were going to rob the place or something. Like, I just asked for a hot dog and fries not all of the money in the cash register, relax. I hate to leave a bad review, but I don't take well to customers being treated differently compared to other customers. And it extends past the employees to the customers as well. I live in the arts district, I pay my dues, so yes I belong here just as much as you do."},{"date":"2014-10-14","rating":"1.0","review":"I really don't wanna rate 1 star, but I was here yesterday, and I was really angry 5 minutes after I got here. The worker's attitude are really bad here. I'm not saying all of the workers, but maybe half of them. To me, they seems like doesn't care about the customers at all. They are just there to make money, and don't wanna even be there. That's how I felt.For the food, I  think it's overpriced for what you get. I got 3 $6 hotdogs, my total was $18+tax = $19.62. I got Bratwurst, Vegetarian Italian, and vegetarian smoked apple sage. All my buns were kinda dry, not moist or tasty. I liked bratwurst. Both veggie dogs were ok, although I just had leftover veggie dogs at home on the next day, and they tasted better than yesterday.. or maybe I was just hungry.So the reason I rated 1 star is because of the rude cashier girl. So my total was $19.62. I used $18 gift card so I had to pay $1.62. First, I gave her $2.02. But then I saw $0.10 in my wallet so I gave her $0.10 extra so I get $0.50 back instead of $0.60 back. She gave me $0.48 back. I told her, I gave her  $2.12 so I should get $0.50 back. She told me back, \"no, I didn't get $0.02. I only got 2.10.\" I told her back, \"no, I gave you $0.02\". And she keep saying \"no, I didn't, didn't get $0.02\".  ..And goes on.I put 2 cents on the table and clearly saw she took my 2 cents first, then took $2 bills, then I gave her another 10 cents, and she can't remember that??Then some other worker said \"check the camera\" so I told her back, \"yeah, check the camera, because I gave you $0.02!\". And she answered \"no, you didn't!\". geez.. She can't remember something just happened a minute ago. She can't remember how much money I gave her and giving me wrong change. And she had such a bad attitude. Someone like her shouldn't handle the money, and shouldn't work in the service industry. I was here for the tastemade event. I expected good food and the service, and have fun with other foodies. This one rude cashier girl ruined everything in just 5 minutes after I got here. I'm still pissed off.

The cashier helped me choose the toppings.  After paying $16, I saw the chef throw the sausages on the grill.  I then went to the dining room and took a seat.  The sausages came out about 10 minutes later.  The Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers came with onions and spicy peppers.  I ate rattlesnake before.  Yes, I am one of those who thinks it tastes like chicken.  But, it was my first time eating rabbit.  The combination of rattlesnake and rabbit worked well.  It was delicious.  If I had know that rabbit had such a good taste, my wife's pet rabbit would no longer be a pet, but, dinner.  The Italian Sausage came with Sweet Peppers.  It also was delicious.  The water here is self serve.  There are a couple of water stations where you can get your own water.  The water is infused with cucumber.  It wasn't really my thing.  I thought it tasted funny.

It was hard to find parking and very busy inside, but for a Saturday night, I can't really complain. Once we found the place, we skipped the food line and went straight back to the bar to order a couple of beers. My first beer tasted kind of off. I know the beer really well, and this glass was too tart and sort of flat compared to how it usually tastes. But we later figured out that there must have been soap in my glass or something, because the second one I had was totally normal and delicious. Between beers, we decided that we did in fact need food, and I waited in the very long line for some kielbasa (boring, I know) and fries. And I am glad that I did! They were both excellent - the sausage was flavorful and the fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The pesto mayo and ranch dipping sauces were good accompaniments, but I would probably get something different next time.  Some downsides: it would be really nice if you could order at the bar instead of waiting in that long line, but I am guessing there are logistical obstacles to that. The music was a little too loud, and combined with the crowd noise, I left with a headache. And I'm a little annoyed about my first beer tasting weird - probably should have complained, but I didn't realize what the problem was until I got the second one and it was fine.

The food is good but the place gets crowded and loud and so it's not great for a bonding conversation. The food is a bit more pricey than I would like, but they seem to use quality ingredients and have some interesting dogs. We sat next to a male and female couple where the man was super gay and the nice wife seemed to not  be able to tell (maybe she likes it that was, not for me to judge) I also like that the name looks like it's called \"worst (area of a woman that rhymes with pootchie)\" Which if you ask me might be intentional.  When I think of a woman's no no place, the flavor of sourkraut and Dijon mustard sounds about right. Although since the main entree is weiners it would be better to maybe call it wurstkock (put an umlaut over something to make it more like a name for a piece of IKEA furniture.)They have a DJ and she loves it when people come up to her and ask her to play La Bamba. You totally should request it and make her your Hipster friend of the month."},{"date":"2014-02-02","rating":"4.0","review":"This place does deserve the ratings it has on yelp. sausage lovers finally have a place to go to Where they can choose from many type of sausages.  From the common to the uncommon. From the expected to the unexpected. From the sausage you expect to try to the sausage that are so weird that you want to try. They have it all. Overall a unique place to try and try multiple times cause once Is just not enough. sausages are Served on fresh baked roll includes two toppings: carmaelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, spicy peppers. you could also order it without the roll as well. it's not cheaper but it'll allow you to try other sausages and not waste food. Ordered:*Duck and bacon with jalapeño peppers. $8 it had a little of an aftertaste to me and i love duck. couldn't finish this sausage. *Buffalo, beef, pork with chipotle peppers $8 personally i preferred this over the duck bacon. *Lamb with Mediterranean spices $8 if u like lamb I would recommend this. *Belgian fries- Groot size is mention for 2 ppl to share. $5.50 & you get two dipping sauces. the two dipping sauces i picked were Curry Ketchup & Chiptole aloei. my boyfriend liked the curry ketchup and i liked the chiptole aloei. bigger fries than what my boyfriend and i usually like to eat but it's worth a try. the following condiments are on the table: Honey mustard, Dijon, whole grain, American yellow, and ketchup.Tips:*Street parking or parking lot that u can pay for parking.  *Indoor and outdoor seating.  *Cash and credit card accepted. *They serve Alcohol.*across the street from the pie hole.*within a short walking distance to little Tokyo. *free water glasses.totally would recommend yelpers to try this joint out at least once."},{"date":"2014-01-13","rating":"4.0","review":"Don't let the line scare you!  Finding parking during peak times, though, can be scary.I was going to Pie Hole for the first time, and spotted the line for this place.  Stephen read the store name, and, being a smart German guy, knew what it was.  We came to the area for Pie Hole, and said we'd come back for Wurstkuche another time.After staring at this place from Pie Hole, I told Stephen to get food to go, and we'll try it for dinner, knowing it won't be the same as eating it fresh.The line was a bit intimidating, as it snaked outside the store.  After walking inside, I thought how odd that no one was eating inside... til I figured out after you place your order, you walk down a long corridor to another room for dining.The dining room was quite large, and there's inside and outside tables.  Most of it is communal dining, so cozy up and meet a new friend.The water they serve is refreshing!! Cucumber water?? Whatever it is, I enjoyed the glass while waiting for my food.  The take out didn't take long, about 10 minutes, and I asked for the condiments on the side.Even after eating our Brat and Bock 4 hours later, it was still very tasty. Yes, the bun was a bit chewy, but I knew it wasn't going to be orgasmic.  The Brat was better than the Bock, and I want to go back and try the FIlipino one next time, with the Belgium fries.  $6 for the sausage,  which seems pretty decent.  They aren't that big, so 1 didn't fill me up, but it also didn't leave me hungry."},{"date":"2014-09-29","rating":"4.0","review":"My first time rolling through my friends and I actually walked right into the bar area and ordered brews then proceeded to seat ourselves.. They had free complimentary steins which I enjoyed then and still do til this day. A manager, or perhaps just a regular staff member, told us if we were going to order anything off the menu it'd need to be ordered in line from the opposite side. In my head I was thinking.. \"but I bought my beer already.\"So our group, steins in hand, go outside and get in line.. And that's when the fun begins. We got a bunch of \"Looky Lou's\" and a \"Debbie Downer\" literally walked right up to us. \"Can you drink beers OUTSIDE of Wurstkuche??!\" a lady asked us confidently. \"I'm not sure, but we're currently doing so\" I replied.*Lady walks in and walks back out with staff member.\"Can they drink these beers outside? I swear there's a sign that says you can't!\" The lady asks the staff member who she went out of her way to grab.\"Umm.. not that I'm aware of. You guys just need to keep those low so we don't get in trouble..\" the staff member politely shrugs us off. \"Ugh, that's not fair\" Lady grunts. \"Here, we'll make this easier and less uncomfortable for you\" I said to this lady. I looked at my friends and we all knew it was time to chug. My friend who doesn't drink at all started the chug chant, and low and behold a few USC students got a kick out of it and joined in the chug festivities. She hated every second of this and basically got quiet and embarrassed. People, mind your business. That's all I have to say about that.. other than I hope to run into her again and brighten her dark day.We finally stepped up to order.. With so much to choose from, making a decision became a daunting task... However, listening to everyone before us ordering I got the vibe on what was popular and what wasn't. They've got your everyday bratwursts to the 'exotic' menu which consists of alligator, rabbit, buffalo and more!I grabbed the Duck & Bacon w/ Jalapeno Pepper Exotic Sausage and Rattlesnack / Jack Rabbit. Maybe my palate was off this day, but both tasted similar.. although the Duck and the Bacon was a little sweeter and tender, while the rattlesnake / rabbit was a little tough and saltier.. Neither was bad, and they were equally mouth wateringly good. I'll need to cone back and try a few more cause these things are packed with flavor! Both were tremendous combined with the multiple brews ordered on tap! You're given a number and are prompted to head back to the seating hall where your food will later be delivered to your seat. The seating is somewhat \"Medieval\".. as in you're sat on long, wooden, festival like tables that seat probably 20-25 on each. No space in between, so be prepared to rub elbows with people you may or may not know! There's a little outside patio too that is nice to sit on due to the fact that you're DTLA and in the arts district.. so vibrant colors and 'hip' people are everywhere!A little crowded for my blood, but with a group of beer drinking buddies that are going in on an empty stomach, Wurstkuche is a great place to grub good and chop it up with some peers and Debbie Downers alike!"},{"date":"2014-09-23","rating":"5.0","review":"Sorting out Wurstküche's pronounciation is enough to make one hungry...\"Vurst-koo-chee\" \"Worst-hoo-chie\" \"Burst-coo-shee\"....oh my aching twisted tongue...Finally our very helpful host of the day John (thanks for all the help!) was there to enlighten us, it's \"Vurst-Khu-kha\"..ahhh!!! finally!! haha  Whatever or however you may want to pronounce the name of this place, I think our main purpose boils down to one thing...The Sausages!!I came here with my officemates for one of those late afternoon lunch, it seems no matter what time you come to this area, parking can either be tough to find or you have to park a few blocks away to get a decent spot. Ordering is actually pretty easy, you can look them up online and read about their menu or come in, fall in-line, get a menu pamphlet and decide what tickles your pickle. Sausage selection are plentiful, toppings come in an assortment of Caramelized sweet onions and sweet peppers, or your regular peppers or Sauerkraut. For me personally, I often look online first to kind of figure out what sounds really interesting ( wurstkuche.com/Eat.html ) so that by the time we're in-line to order the only thing that could possibly change my mind is if I see something that looks far better than what I had previously imagined and relished in my head... uhm..like those stacks of mouth-watering sausages in the display cabinet...haha On this visit I was planning on the fiery Louisiana Hot link but by the time I passed the display cabinet and was about to give my order I decided to get the Mango Jalapeno Sausage with a topping of Caramelized onions and sweet peppers. *grin* , I also ordered a side of Belgian fries (Large \"Groot\") with truffle oil glaze which also includes 2 dipping sauce.. I opted for the Chipotle Aioli & Sun dried Tomato Mayo..YUM!They have quite a few beer & beverage selection with the Unsweetened Darjeeling tea as one of the most popular, however, for today I just decided to get a bottle of San Pellegrino. My Mango Jalapeno sausage was delish,(chicken & turkey based), very flavorful and moist, the caramelized onion topping and sweet onions really gave this meal a delicious layer of flavor which made me wished I ordered 2 of these babies lol If I did not have the Belgian fries to finish, I might have went back in front and ordered another *grin*..yes, It's Deliciozo!My sister also had the Mango Jalapeno, My friends - the Sun Dried Tomato Mozzarella sausage which is also Chicken & Turkey based, and the Kielbasa - all received lovely comments from them with two thumbs up! The Belgian fries serving whether you order \"Klein or Groot\" (Sm or Lg) was pretty filling, those spuds like your typical Belgian fries are cut in hefty sizes...don't forget to dip 'em! those dipping sauce are fantastic!We truly enjoyed Wurstküche's offering, the sausages are amazing, the staff are fantastic (Thanks John!!), the place - very relaxed and good for groups! There is indoor and al fresco seating if watching zooming cars and people watching is your thing..okay okay--open air seating... hahaI definitely recommend trying out Wurstküche, the crowd is a mix of the young and old, professionals, students and your typical curious crowd. Keep an open mind and an open palate, be adventurous to try the gourmet sausages!..who knows! \"Vurst-koo-chee\" \"Worst-hoo-chie\" \"Burst-coo-shee\" might have the sausage that you've been dreaming of for a very very long time!Enjoy!"},{"date":"2014-10-03","rating":"5.0","review":"Out of this world!Came here last night with one of my friends on her recommendation. Normally, she and I always eat Asian food (she is Chinese, after all), however, I wanted something different. She recommended Wurstküche and I am glad she did.I went in expecting the place to be like The Back Abbey in Claremont. In one sense, it is - they have Belgian and German draft beers on tap, and serve pomme-frites with dipping sauces. They are most notably known for their expansive selection of hot dogs - and boy do they have a great selection. This is no Dodger dog (eww), Weinerschnitzel, or even a Pink's dog, This is straight up amazingness for your tastebuds. Let's look at the menu, shall we?

Now that you've seen it, why are you still reading my review? Why aren't you saying, \"Honey, call the babysitter, we're going to Wurstküche?!\" Because that's what you should be saying.The vibe is super chill. You order your food up front along with your beer, get a table # (they bring the food to you), and then you make your way down a long hallway, past the restrooms, and into a large dining room. There are several booths along the wall, and three large community tables in the middle of the dining room. Additionally, there is a large bar up against the wall. My friend and I sat in an alcove area, near the DJ. Oh yeah, they have a DJ. Additionally, they have a small outside dining area.For dinner, I had the Austin Blues and a Blanche de Bruxelles white Begian ale. Both were amazingly delicious. While I was tempted to order a second dog, I knew I would be full after eating so many pomme-frites. And yep, I was right - about 20 minutes later my friend and I went across the street to a farmer's market, and I felt the fullness.That said - the meal was totally worth it. Come hungry, and enjoy your fill of the goodness that is Wurstküche.If you're going to visit, scratch that, WHEN YOU VISIT, make sure you come early - they are known to have a line outside the door."},{"date":"2014-10-21","rating":"4.0","review":"Apparently, it is not \"worst-cooch\" like my friends and I all assumed.

This is located in the arts district in downtown LA. This place has changed so much over the years. It has become gentrified and quite a dense urban area. I like that it's changing with the revitalization of rest of downtown LA.  We arrived and found parking on the streets. There were random people walking on the streets and in wheelchairs so please be careful people, especially at night. We walked up and there were people sitting outside and we went in to order.The place to order was small but you eventually had to walk in and down a hallway to reach the seats and bar.  We ordered our food. I ordered the buffalo and pork sausage hotdog with large fries and a German beer. I was already a bit tipsy then and so when the cashier asked what toppings I wanted on there, I just spaced out and didn't know where the toppings were on the menu. My bad dude lol. I ordered, paid and went to go find a seat. Overall, I spent $23.72 for the sausage  hotdog,  large fries and German beer. A bit expensive but you get the convenience of having good food and beer. So I ordered, took my numbered placecard and walked down the hall to go find a seat. This was about 11pm, so there was plenty of seats. Was given a placecard with a number and we just waited for our food. The beer was delicious and in no time, the food arrived. I like that the restaurant had different sauces and condiments for fries. The sausage was Smokey and tasted similar to a pork and beef sausage. I liked that the hotdog bun was grilled to an extent and kept it warm. The buns were sweet and had a nice texture. I think if the sausages were a bit bigger, I'd taste more of the flavors of the sausage than just having majority of bread in my mouth. I had two toppings of grilled onions and sweet peppers. They were good but a bit cooled down once I bit into it. I liked dipping them into the curry ketchup and pesto mayo. The fries were like steak fries. They were okay, nothing out of the ordinary but went well with the condiments. I should have gotten the fries with the white truffle oil glaze for extra flavor. We had a good time just chatting and eating and left satisfied. I really enjoyed my food and the atmosphere. Would I back? Sure, whenever I'll be in the arts district again..."},{"date":"2015-05-10","rating":"5.0","review":"Always reliable Wurstkuche!Parking is horrendous, be ready to make some loops.

The staff was attentive, food and drinks were great, and I got to try something new."},{"date":"2014-11-20","rating":"4.0","review":"Even with the full-on Yelp effect, Wurstküche is still somewhat an enjoyable experience.I used to frequent establishments with legitimate claims to having the best brats/wursts in town (e.g. Rosamunde's in SF/NYC, Uli's up North, Frank in Austin) yet I can't really confess to having a distinguished palate when it comes to sausages. Sure, the exotic options like Buffalo, Rattlesnake, or Pheasant seem enticing, but if you were to blindfold me and put the three plus maybe a control sausage next to it and ask me to tell them apart, could I do it? Probably not. Do I think any of the other 6000+ yelp reviewers that have hyped up this establishment are capable of achieving the above feat? Maybe, but I remain on the skeptical side.Keeping the idea of \"exotic\" hot dogs on the back burner, my paradigm of a \"good hot dog\" can be illustrated with the following feedback loop:Is sausage hot? -- If yes, continue; if no, then bad hot dog. Is the bun toasted? -- If no, continue; if yes, then bad hot dog. Does sausage kind of \"crunch\" when you bite into it and release a variety of flavors ranging from spicy to sweet and maybe even salty --  If yes, continue; if no, then bad hot dog. Is the sausage purportedly made of an animal that would bring you immense satisfaction if you were locked in a cage fight and you had to beat it to death with your bare hands? -- If hell yes, continue; if omg wtf is wrong with you, then bad hot dog.Are there some veggies in the way of your sausage that will prevent you from scarfing your 8+ dollar gourmet sausage too fast? -- If yes, continue; if no then bad hot dog.Did the act of eating this hot dog make you grow a full-on beard, and another muscle-y arm under said beard -- If yes, good hot dog; if no, then normal hot dog.Diversions aside, there was somewhat of an outlandish wait for myself and my friend to get into this establishment. Lucky for us, our outlandish wait was somewhat mitigated by the fact that one of the awesome Wurstküche employees felt bad and started handing out samples of their featured sausage (I think it was the mango, which I'm deathly allergic to), and by the fact that there was a short obnoxiously drunk lesbian in line directly across from us making all kinds of a scene, with her seemingly cis and hetero friends trying their best at damage control. Once the novelty of the lesbian outburst wore off, another Wurstküche employee made his rounds and started taking beer orders. This helped, but not tremendously as I made it to beer #2 by the time I got to the order line. Point of the story being, the wait--like any other accredited place in this city--is miserable, but the establishment seems well aware of the fact and seems to go out of their way to accommodate and make it slightly less infuriating for all parties involved.Good food (almost all of their offerings passed my ridiculous flowchart), good beer (I would ideally like to see more IPAs/Sours to complement some of the more exotic and/or spicy sausages. The one Berliner Weisse that they had was okay, but not great), one screaming lesbian, and a very accommodating staff; this would be a five star joint for me if it were more of a biergarten and less of a wannabe-lounge/EDM club inside."},{"date":"2014-10-14","rating":"5.0","review":"Finally tried this place today and so mad I didn't come sooner.

My favorites are the Kielbasa, the duck and Filipino sausage. The fries are a must. They are fried to perfection since I love crispy fries. Now the beer. Omg if you love beer come here. They serve you your beer in the appropriate cups. A majority of their beers are german so don't look for American beers. Best of all, they have a Kranz.

Portions are small, prices are high.FOOD:~ FYI, You can choose two toppings on any of the sausages. I chose caramelized onions and sweet peppers on top. At the tables, they have a variety of mustards like whole grain, dijon, spicy brown, honey mustard, american yellow, and ketchup.~~ Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers, $8 ~~ Tasted like a normal spicy hot dog or sausage. Nothing special except the fact that it's from snake and rabbit.~~ Lamb with Mediterranean Spices, $8 ~~ Lamb was pretty good, but wasn't worth the price!~~ Large Belgian fries, $5.50 ~~ Comes with two dipping sauces. The chipotle aioli was pretty good. Skip the chipotle ketchup, it was weird. I would have picked something else if I knew there would be ketchup at the tables. Fries are put through the fryer twice, which makes them nice and crisp on the outside and still soft on the inside. However, portion for this was tiny! I would be scared to see how many fries come in a small.ALKY:Tip: Check the portion sizes because different drinks come in different sizes. So you might think you're buying a cheaper beer but in reality it's tiny!~~ Aspall English Cider, $11 ~~ I'm a cider gal, so I ordered the only cider on the menu. It didn't taste like a cider and I forced myself to finish it cuz it cost $11!~~ Früli, $8 ~~ Tried a sample of it (they do give you small samples if you ask) and it was pretty good! Very fruity beer, but it's $8 for 330mL.LOCATION:Hard to find parking (you're in downtown LA so what can you expect though). Metered parking around and if you get lucky you'll find some free street parking.SERVICE: There was a waitress taking orders of beer when you got closer to the front but she was impatient and gave off a vibe that she didn't want to be here working. She was really picky about where we stood and that we had to be close to the wall and move forward immediately as soon as there was space, even if it got in the way of those walking through to the tables. ATMOSPHERE: The line was out the door and moved super slow. There's only one cashier so that may be why, but when we got to the cashier we already knew our order since we'd been waiting so long, so I don't know why it still takes that long. After you order, you move to the back of the place to find parking. It's dark and loud inside, so not great if you want to have an actual conversation without yelling. OVERALL: Wouldn't come back. Wouldn't even suggest you to try it once, unless you're dying to experience a place with so many Yelp reviews."},{"date":"2015-08-01","rating":"3.0","review":"My boyfriend and I both got the rattlesnake & rabbit and thought it was alright.

If so, you should visit Wurstkuche (\"kuche\" means \"kitchen\" in German) in the Arts District of Downtown LA.You can opt to pay for parking across the street, or try your luck in finding street parking. Once you've passed that first hurdle, there's usually a nice long line here during lunch and dinner. During this time, you'll want to start making up your mind as to which sausage and beer you'd like to have.They have a variety of meats (the pictures do more justice than me describing it), but things like rabbit and rattlesnake are common. There's also different sausages fused or injected with different spices or sauces like the duck bacon jalapeno sausage (which I had during my visit here. Highly recommended). I also ordered a side of the Belgian fries, but found it was only okay. You'll definitely want to save more room for the sausages more than the fries.Knowing that their patrons are probably getting thirsty standing in line, the staff usually tries to get your drink order well ahead of you making your food order. I had a Blanche de Bruxelles beer to go along with my two wursts in my last visit and just about finished it by the time I paid for my order.Once determining and paying for your items, you're given a table number and you proceed to the dining room or patio. There, you can order more beer and find a seat to enjoy the food. There are water stations in the rear for those avoiding beer or trying to be a good designated driver for the group.The interior reminds me more of a typical German Oktoberfest set up, complete with long wooden benches and shared tables. Even if you come by yourself (and there is nothing wrong with that!), you can definitely find something to talk about with your neighbors regarding the exotic food.

LOL the blend of the rattlesnake and rabbit was brilliant! i've never had reptile before, but i could definitely taste the exoticness in the sausage.  quite subtle~ the rabbit draws it to a happy medium.  i would def get it again!really glad i stopped in this place!  if i have the opportunity, i would definitely return to try other things and grab a beer!"},{"date":"2016-01-02","rating":"4.0","review":"Great selection of wurst.  Great mustards.   Pricey..   I have gone with friends over a period of time and shared all of the dogs in order to try them all...    I can't decide which is best I like them all!!!     I wish they sold better sodas though.

THIS IS KEY. TRUFFLE. OIL. And you choose sauce (1 for a small and 2 for a large). I love the chipotle aioli.

I doused every bite with thick grainy mustard and savored the deliciousness.  The fries were good but not great; they were thicker crunchy fries, double-fried as I understand it and I did not see nor taste any truffle oil.

Pro- tip: But the line for the ordering area is on Traction.If you come in the wrong door later in the day, the eating area is very dimly lit.Again, is that part of the charm?The aisle are not very wide table length-wise.  Only one person can walk comfortably.Hard to tell who works there or not.  But after seeing a guy bus a table, I ask him where do I go to order food, based on reading the reviews.He tells me to go down the hallway to the counter.I make my way to the counter.  Yes, it is well lit.  Hmmm.The line snakes along the triangular spaced entrance and out into the nighttime cold.  They have staff working the line.They herd us like cattle with these commands:Stand along the wall.  Move over.  Squeeze together.  Would you like a drink?Our credit card machine is working slowly.  We are out of Hot Italian and Louisiana Hot Link ( I think).I am not sure how to interpret slowly working.  Is it sick?  Still recovering from NYE?  They of course accept cash.  Cash is king.  Or so they say.  Idioms. They were offering samples of the Austin Blues to compensate for our extra long wait time and for the slowly working credit card machine.After 15-20 mins, we finally reach the front of the line.We order two dogs, Austin Blues with onions and sweet peppers.I wanted the Hot Italian but had to settle with Brockworst.  Based on the counter, they had tons of sausages. Is Hot Italian that popular?We grab a table.  My guest did not want to partake in the communal table space.We sit in the dark waiting/hoping that the server can see our number.Finally, someone brings our food.  Yeah.Here is my pic of my hot dog: yelp.com/biz_photos/wurs…I grab some of the fries.  Hoping to enjoy the Bleu Cheese Walnut & Baconthat everyone seems to rave about.  Yuck my fries are semi-warm.I spend some time trying to locate someone to flag down.After a bit, I decide to walk back to the counter.As I approach, I ask a guy if he works here.  Yes, he replies.I mention that my fries were luke-warm.  Nothing.  Just a blank stare.Hmmm.  Now annoyed, I ask for 2 to-go containers.He grabs some stuff, turns around, and hands it to me.I walk down that long dark hallway back to the dining area.I am thinking what a waste.  Where is the customer service?I noticed on how they had fries just sitting next to the fryer.  No wonder they were luke-warm.  I guess that they can mess up a simple thing like fries.They could have easily replaced my fries and made me a happy camper.Mess with my starch?  My fries?  Honestly, that was my main reason for coming.I wanted to taste their Belgium fries with their sauces.  But alas, this was not meant to be.Maybe I should have gone to their Venice location.Maybe they were so focused on their credit card machine not working.Tainted view of this place?  Maybe. Slightly.  Okay, yes.This review was written when I got back.  So definitely.Overall, hard to locate.  They blew simple customer service 101.I would not recommend this place due to the bitter taste of lack of service.Will my review affect their business, probably not.Will it affect me spending anymore money at this place, yes.I am tossing and turning in my bed as I lust for fries."},{"date":"2015-10-08","rating":"5.0","review":"First time ever and there amazing selections on Beer and exotic Food.

It gets pretty loud in here, but that's what you expect for a spot serving nothing but beer and bratwurst. They have very exotic and interesting types of hot dogs, so be adventurous. I usually order the mango jalepeno ($8) with grilled onions and spicy peppers. You also can choose from sweet peppers and sauerkraut as your toppings. My friend and I also shared a large order of the fries ($5). These fries are a must as they're a thick and crispy cut. It comes with a choice of dipping (one for small; two for large). We got the chipotle aioli and buttermilk ranch. I like the taste of each, but you also have a variety of mustards and ketchup on the tables for free.

The unique thing here is that you can order and sip a beer while standing in line! Thats legit. I had a German IPA that was fresh and bitter tasting but was enough to get me on. Pretty expensive for $8 a glass though but once again, they are imports. I ordered the rabbit-rattlesnake sausage which was gamey, tasted like chicken, and had this roasted peppery taste. This was one of the most exotic things I've ever tried and what better way to have it in a hot dog form. This is a great place for friends and family; a group. The experience is great! You can mingle and meet new people around you. I recommend coming here around midnight or close to that time because it's live and people come to drink and have fun.I'll def be coming back for more!

The fries are good but their dipping sauces are FANTASTIC. My two favorites are the sun-dried mayo and chipotle aioli.

Wasn't packed at all and had plenty of open seating available (cafeteria style)Tried the Rattlesnake & Rabbit.. Man that sausage was freakin good! Mildly spicy, juicy and just pure perfection. For the toppings, I went the caramelized onions and jalapeños just for an extra kick of spice. Along with the sausage, I had the Belgian fries cooked in white truffle oil glaze. YUM! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are plenty of dipping sauces to choose from but since I'm such a huge ketchup fan, I just stuck with the regular ketchup. However, I did try the chipotle aioli & curry ketchup and thise two sauces seem to be the most popular.

I've yet to try something I didn't love (though I haven't tried the veggie dogs yet - but my cousin did and said they were awe-some, so that sorta counts). Anyway, I love everything here from the options of toppings (caramelized onions belong on everything, in my opinion) and the myriad of sauces you can choose from (including an all-you-can handle sized squirt-bottle of almost every kind of mustard imaginable.

Given the fact that lines can extend up to 30 min+, definitely not worth the wait. No wait? It's a great place to grab a quick, albeit expensive, bite. I appreciate how Japadog and Seoul Sausage get creative with their toppings to jazz it up quite a bit, but here it's limited to peppers, onions, sauerkraut.Admittedly, the other sausages are top-notch. I enjoyed the spiciness of the Austin. The belgian fries are also on-point -- perfectly golden brown, crispy, and so thick it's like eating a fry with mashed potatoes inside.

That sounded kind of weird... let me explain.If you like sausages, you will like Wurstkuche. Okay, that sounded even weirder.

The total came out to around $15.There is a huge poorly-lit room in the back of the place that has cafeteria-style seating and a bar. You'll find bottles of ketchup, mustard, and other condiments on the tables for your enjoyment. The food comes out fairly fast, even when there are long lines - I believe my hot dog was in front of me in 5-10 minutes. Yay!The sausage itself was alright... I thought it was a little salty and I didn't really taste any mango in it. The beer was pretty good. However, what stuck out to me was their fries. THEIR FRIES ARE DELICIOUS!

But when I want to eat a hot dog, I come here :PAlthough I have heard of this place from several  friends, I didn't go here until my first time this summer. What's great about this place is that it's vegetarian friendly (I use to be a pescatarian and was one when I first came here). So I have had both the vegetarian options and the meat ones. The Chipotle Vegetarian is pretty damn good 4.5/5 stars. I like spicy and this dog is spicy. The Filipino dog: Okay, let's keep it real. I HAD to try this one especially that I am Filipino. It is a sweet pork and just as sweet as regular longinisas (Filipino sausage) I like. If only I had a fried egg and rice, I would have eaten this dog sans the bun. Not so bad, not so bad 4/5 stars. Fries: pretty legit I must say. Whenever I eat here and eat only the dog, I feel less fulfilled but these fries will help fill you up. As far as toppings, there is a select few. I always opt for the caramelized onions and the sweet peppers. And with sauces, there's a bunch of squirt bottles with all your needs: ketchup, mustard, honey mustard, whole grain mustard, and the list goes on and on. Environment itself is pretty cool. I always like the old school hip hop music they play. Sometimes there's a DJ indoors which is cool. There's also an outdoor seating area, meaning, this place is dog friendly.

Nancy had the duck and bacon with jalapeno peppers, while I chose the rabbit, veal and pork in white wine. We also decided to split an order of fries. The fries were tasty and you were able to select to condiments to accompany it.  We went with a  sun dried tomato sauce and buttermilk ranch.  How can you go wrong with either?  I thought the taste of the sausages was pretty good but not mind blowing.  My biggest gripe is that I wish the sausages were bigger.  Next time I would opt for a small or no fries in favor of a 2nd sausage. There is a bar in back of this restaurant which is situated on an odd corner...like a little triangle.   You order in front which has minimum seating but there is more seating in the back. Price wise its ok...I get it for the \"rarity\" of what they're offering.  However, if you're looking for bang for your don't count on it.  You'll be hungry later after dropping some cash at this spot.

I pronounced it 5 different ways and you should know how to pronounce it. The line was out the door. Check. Spot must be worth the wait/good. LA = can't rush anything. I'm learning. Heard this place had a mean sausage / hotdog thing and it was pretty good. Other than the wait, which took about 45 minutes, everything else was great. I ordered one of their exotic sausages: rattlesnack and pork. I got caramelized onions and spicy peppers. It was really good. The sausage was cooked with just a thin layer of crispiness, and the vegetables really brought out the flavors. I wanted to try the begian fries but I was too full. Really this place gets their novelty because of their exotic meats I think. To be quite honest, the sausage just tasted like sausage. I guess that's a good thing? I certainly didn't taste any rattlesnake.. Not that I know what that would've tasted like before, but I've heard it tastes like chicken. I really liked the bun, yeah I know weird. The bun was not a hotdog bun but it was like a roll. Really had a nice touch to it. Next time, I will try their beers and belgian fries. When you walk in to order, it looks pretty small. They have cucumber water for customers which is a nice touch. They have a lot of beers. I didn't try any cause I had my fair share but it's a great spot for some European/German/Belgian/etc. beers. You initially think it's a pretty small spot but when you walk towards the back, it's pretty big. You can fit what looked like 50 people, possibly more. They have a DJ and the ambience is just great. Apparently, it's a family restaurant. There's some outdoor seating as well which is just fabulous. Overall, I think a 4 is fair. The sausage tasted like sausage. I didn't try anything else so I can't even comment on that - but I'm sure I would've enjoyed it. However, I do believe everyone should check out this place if you're in downtown LA."},{"date":"2015-07-06","rating":"2.0","review":"We went to have dinner 4 of us, we ordered 4 hot dogs and one order of fries, guess what?

Entering from Traction, you order your sausage at the counter (after waiting in the ENORMOUS line), which is then called out back in the dining room. After walking down the hallway, you enter a huge open room with a long bar and incredibly loud music. Generally speaking, they have long lacquered picnic tables and benches for communal dining. There are a few smaller tables around the edge of the room and on the outdoor patio. This is a place for young people and not a place for those over 30ish or for children.Because we had a big group, we had the opportunity to taste SIX different sausages (which range from $6 to $8) which are served on an ordinary oversized hot dog bun. Generally, each sausage has a crisp casing and a juicy interior (except the vegetarian Italian, which is pretty dry). When you order your sausage, you pick two toppings - caramelized onions, sweet peppers, jalapenos or sauerkraut. I skip the jalapenos (I prefer the spicy sausages which have enough heat on their own) and the sauerkraut (not my fav). Because I want A LOT of onion, I generally order double onions, but the sweet mix of cooked yellow and red bell peppers are good too. We had:Bratwurst - classic pork sausage that is mild flavored. Very good staple.Vegetarian Italian - an interesting sausage that I think is grain based and is seasoned with fennel, garlic and roasted red bell peppers (little bits). If you are a vegetarian, this is a great meat substitute. If you are a meat fan, this is not a great substitute. It is really seasoned filler.Mango Jalapeno - this was one of the two BEST sausages that we had. It is made from chicken and turkey, so it is juicy without being very heavy, and it is very flavorful, sweet and spicy.Buffalo Beef with Pork - this excellent lean meaty sausage is seasoned with chipotle, which gives it a smoky flavor. This was the other of the two BEST.Duck - this was definitely a very close third before the two that were tied for first place. A richly flavored sausage that was not overly greasy with a little heat (there is much more jalapeno in the mango sausage). I could not discern any bacon flavor, but it is very good.Snake/Rabbit - this is a very good sausage but it is REALLY rich. I was surprised that snake and rabbit was much richer than the duck. I would say that the heat profile is the same as the duck - pretty mild.Other than sausages, they offer French fries with a variety of dipping sauces. I don't eat potatoes, so I skip these. They are very popular. There is also a plentiful beer selection. I had a sip of a dark beer that was good.Overall, it's like Oktoberfest year round here - sausages, fries and beer amid a constant racket with lots of young people and communal dining. If that's your thing, this is the place to be. For me, it's okay if I am in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip."},{"date":"2014-10-19","rating":"4.0","review":"I liked this place.

They also offer plenty of condiments on each table.  As for the location, since its in DTLA parking around here kind of suck.  But that's not their fault.  For the actual place, its broken up into two sides.  The larger room is the seating and bar area connected by a back narrow alley to the smaller food ordering room.  You place your food orders from the smaller room, and take the \"number sign\" and place it on your table and wait for your food.  Both rooms have entrances but the entrance to the larger room is kind of hidden from outside and can be hard to find.  There's no signs outside the door, its just a giant wooden door at the corner of the street.  If you're trying to look for it, its diagonally opposite from Angel City Brewery."},{"date":"2014-10-16","rating":"4.0","review":"Wurstkuche, however you end up pronouncing it is a German sausage restaurant serving up exotic meats such as rattlesnake and rabbit to name a few. Located near Jtown, be prepared to pray to the parking Gods to find street parking, if not you can always pay for the lot which is a total rip off IMO.  We came here for a Tastemade event and got a gift card for $18 to spend. Anyways, we came on a Monday and it was still pretty packed, I can only imagine how busy it can get during a weekend. The food will come out slow since the grill is only the size of a small table so be prepared to wait a bit. They do offer complementary water while you wait though you may want to get one to get one of their many beers that they have on tap. You can pick from a wide variety of different sausages, the highlights being the exotic ones which are $8 each. I got the rabbit and veal combination. They also offer up a list of beers varying from many different IPA's though they were out of the one I wanted to try sadly so I ended up getting the Duchesse De Bourtgogne.There is a large seating area inside as well as outside seating. The inside seating is very dark so I suggest sitting outside where there is more light as well being able to experience the nice air at night.Overall the experience was decent though if it were up to me I would still prefer dog haus over this place since dog haus caters more to my tastes and has tater tots!!"},{"date":"2014-02-05","rating":"5.0","review":"Everyone has already left such wonderful reviews so I'll just put in my two cents.If you live in LA, no Southern California in general, and you've never been here... you need to go.

I have been wanting to visit Wurstkuche for a long time because I knew it was one of the most reviewed places on Yelp. Almost 6,000 reviews?! The Yelp Elite in me KNEW that I had to take a trip out to DTLA to try this place out! Sadly, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be =/Fortunately the bratwursts were cheaper than I thought they would be, but I ended up spending almost $20 because I got fries with truffle oil, and an orange jigger as well. I was torn between four of their brats, so one of the guys working there recommended the Filipino Maharlika because it had a nice sweet flavor. I was curious to try this one because I'm Filipino, and wanted to compare it to what I've had in the past. My friend got the chicken apple? brat. The brats come with your choice of 2 of the 4 toppings, but I only got mine with onions because I refuse to eat sauerkraut.The brats were really unimpressive! The flavor of my brat alone was not that great at all... My friend commented and said they tasted like normal bratwursts that you could probably pick up at the grocery store and cook yourself. I know Wurstkuche is known for having exotic bratwursts like alligator, rabbit, etc...but I was not about to be that adventurous. Sadly I was disappointed by my Filipino Maharlika as it didn't really resemble what I remember eating growing up. Also, I felt like because I didn't put any sauce (mustard/ketchup) on my hot dog, it was really dry. I wasn't a huge fan of the hot dog buns they had which were kind of bland and dry...so that was a letdown altogether. My orange jigger was strange. It wasn't what I was expecting, and I felt like I was drinking a hard cider even though I was expecting it to be more like orange cream soda. Kinda disappointing!The reason why I would ever return back to Wurstkuche is because of their FRIES. Holy. fricking. crap. I think their fries may be quite possibly the BEST fries I have ever had in my life. And that's a pretty big statement for me to say because I've had a lot of french fries in my life. My friend and I were blown away by how good their fries were! AND they have a variety of dipping sauces to choose from, which is super awesome! The cashier recommended the pesto mayo to me, and I REALLY enjoyed it! It was absolutely perfect and paired really well with the fries. The only thing is I regret getting mine with truffle oil. I paid $2 extra for the truffle oil and it wasn't really noticeable. If I hadn't known there was truffle oil on it, I probably wouldn't have recognized it. Waste of $2! But still...man....my mouth is literally watering just thinking about those heavenly fries... *drools*Overall, I was a tad bit disappointed with Wurstkuche, but I'm glad that I found one thing I LOVED on their menu - THE FRIES! If I were to ever return, I would probably just order a large order of fries and call it a day. Maybe I'll try another brat...but with what I've had so far, I wasn't super impressed. 3 stars, but an extra 0.5 for the amazing fries :)"},{"date":"2014-09-15","rating":"4.0","review":"HUGE fan of this place.

Oh, and it's open super late. Try anything they have, I bet you it's good. Can't say that for too many places. Service is friendly, and surprisingly efficient. We even had a crazy guy making a commotion inside that was dealt with really well by the staff. If it's your first time here, do yourself a favor and try something different. Last time we tried the Austin Blues and Duck & Bacon dogs. AB was not what I'd call spicy, but it was definitely a solid middle ground type taste. The D&B however, was pretty freaking good. The fries are amazing so don't hesitate. They have a ton of great dipping sauces, or some hipster ketchup if nothing strikes your fancy. Negatives.. Well, parking is becoming more of a pain as time goes on. There is a $2 lot, and street parking - but it was feeling cramped the last time I visited. That was on a Wednesday night too. Then there's the price. If you feel like having a beer, small fries, and a hot dog - you're out a minimum of 17.50. That's without even figuring out what rattle snakes taste like or if white truffle oil glaze is worth it. Great spot for a night out with friends, or to get wasted and debate the merits of that stupid Steve Nash trade."},{"date":"2016-01-01","rating":"5.0","review":"I love this place!!

Hipster indeed, but a must try. Order at the meat counter in front and then realize the place is larger as it seemed while waiting in line. Take your number to a communal table (or smaller one if you're lucky) and wait for your sausage to arrive.What I've tried:Austin blues- The fiancé had this and I was able to try it. Good snap and spicy flavor. Wish I had ordered this one.Vegetarian Chipotle- spicy and good chipotle flavor. I decided that being a vegetarian wasn't for me, but this would be a good substitute if I didn't have a choice. The texture was a bit off, but of course I was comparing to my fiance's Austin Blues.Filipino Maharlika- tried this on a previous visit and it wasn't too memorable. I of course had to try it though as  Filipino myself.Belgian Fries- this is a must! And the curry ketchup is amazing!The only reason I'd come back is to take curious visitors.

Be ready for a line that stretches to the outside. But thats ok, great things require time. When you make it inside they hand you a menu and ask if you would like anything to drink while you wait in line. They have quite the selection of meats. Since it was my first time i went for the Pheasant, Rabbit and Rattlesnake, and the Louisiana Hot Link. They were all great! Every meat different in their own way but delicious regardless. Complemented with some fries and a beer it was simply fantastic. I have one problem with this place though, it seems no one knows how to really pour a beer into a glass. What I mean is that when I would receive my beer, a little less than half of my beer was foam. I understand a layer of foam but when almost half of the glass is foam, you simply do not know how to serve a beer. It wasn't the first time and not the same bartender too. I tried a variety of beers because they have a great selection that I wanted to try. The same problem over and over and over again. I even overheard a guy telling his friends, \"I paid 8 dollars for a half full glass? what the hell is mickey mouse s***!\" So that is my only real grievance with this place. Maybe they were told to serve the beer this way? Who knows.

Personally, I come for the great beer selection and their fries with truffle oil. Thank you baby Jesus in a manger for their truffle fries! You don't even need dipping sauces when your order their fries with truffle oil.I'm a vegetarian, so I'm limited to three options on their sausage menu, which is fine, I'm never disappointed. Hey, three options is a lot better than most places! My favorite is the Mexican chipotle,which actually isn't spicy at all (at least not to me). Also, all my meat eating friends who go with me have nothing but good things to say about their sausage selections. I really think the big selling point for Wurstküche is their ambiance. Because can you get great tasting food, cooked the right way, and a large German/ European beer selection at other locations? Yes. Of course, especially in LA. But as an Army brat, who was born in Munich, Germany, this place feeds my nostalgia as well as my stomach. Their open dining room with large bench seating reminds me of the annual Oktoberfest and it's always fun eating here, whether it be a quick bite before a Dodger game or an extended stay with lots of friends and lots of rounds of Spaten and Bitburger. Definitely give this place a try. Yes, its' a bit of a hipster joint, yes, it's a little overpriced, yes, it's trendy. But it's fun.

Everyone seems to forget about the line they just waited in. It's one of those places that everyone just needs to try once, and figure out if they want to be a regular or a one timer. The exotic meat is definitely eye catching, and where else will you try rattlesnake, rabbit, or veal. The truffle fries could use a bit more truffle, so ask for extra. I'm also into more thinner fries. Sauces! Love how you have so much to try out to figure out the perfect combo.suggestionsDont be afraid to try the rattlesnake & rabbit. If I can do it, you can!

According to one of the co-owner, Tyler Wilson,  Wurstküche is pronounced very similar to \"Voos-kee-ka\" meaning sausage kitchen. You will probably get a different pronunciation if you ask the Internet. Most likely, a fluent German speaking person will tell you that the word doesn't exist. So who knows.All I have to say is this place is expensive if you want to get drunk. If you're just looking to eat a hot dog and small fries with a beer, you will survive having to spend about $20. Good thing is that portions are fulfilling. People tend to be satisfied with the length and girth of the würst, and most people aren't greedy and become satisfy with just one. Sometimes some people feel brave and claim \"l've done this before, I know I can handle more than two würste\". Anyways, the  small order of fries are the equivalent of approximately one large potato. When it comes to the parking situation I have some good news, and unfortunately some bad new. The good news is that down Traction Avenue there's plenty of free parking spots with a 4 hour limit. The bad news is that you have be lucky or simply patient to get a spot. Your other option is to pay a few dollars at the parking lot, or there's some meters down 3rd street. Then, you may get traumatized when you see a 20 person line forming outside of the building, but it's not as bad as it seems. When you walk into the place, you immediately encounter the cooler with all the sausages, the kitchen, the beer spouts, and the cash register. The hallway to the right will lead you to the restrooms on your left side, and down the hall you have the dining room and the bar. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that if there's 20 people outside, then there's about 5 more people inside waiting in line; therefore, there's a fast moving line composed of 25 people. You will not have to confront a 25 person line, and most likely be lucky finding a parking spot if you know the correct time to visit. During the weekdays avoid the lunch rush hour between 11:30 to 2, and avoid the weekends. Wurstküche is located in the Arts District, so that means this area is Mecca for hipsters. If you're like Anthony Bourdain where hipster make him feel a type way, then all I have to say is to not panic. The only thing that you'll see are hipsters, non hipsters, old , and young drinking fancy beers (except the children) and taking bites off their würste ."},{"date":"2015-02-22","rating":"5.0","review":"J'adore this place!!!

(as a guy)  I suppose it adds a little bit of uniqueness and something to see.- Price - 7 - Kinda pricey but I did just try rattlesnake sooo I guess its not that bad.  I shouldn't expect to pay pork prices for rattlesnake (even if its functionally not much different).- Booze - Didn't try, so no mark.So hope this is helpful.  I'll try it again when I come back in the area, and maybe have a drink or something and may update this."},{"date":"2015-05-22","rating":"4.0","review":"I like right around the corner so I come by from time to time, but I always find myself disappointed with the hot dogs.

WARNING: If you don't eat pork, your menu options will be very limited. Every sausage here, except for the chicken apple sausage and the vegetarian sausages, contains pork. Wurstkuche is located in the small, but interesting downtown arts district, replete with hipsters and good walking (just make sure not to stray into the dangerous abutting areas). There was a line when we went, and that seems to be pretty common. The line goes quickly - in our case, we ordered at the counter after about 15-20 minutes, and then went and found a seat.Atmosphere: This is where this establishment stands out. What makes it unique is the long, picnic-like tables where you sit, next to perfect strangers. The idea, I think, is to get random people talking to each other, but in reality people tend to stick to their own cliques. If you want privacy, you can sit in the surrounding booths like we did (the long picnic-tables were all full). There is a DJ spinning good music, and it's dark inside. The place is filled to the brim with hipsters.Food: A large beer selection, including a cider. The hot dogs are unique and delicious.

Although I wasn't quite adventurous enough (I had the Duck and Bacon sausage), I was still very impressed with the food. The White Truffle Oil infused fries were to die for and perish the thought that I should ever come here again without ordering these. To notch it up, I got two containers of Pesto and Mayo dipping sauce, shoved some fries in the sandwich and slathered this dipping sauce on it. Yeah...mouth's watering just thinking about it. Additionally, the staff was quite friendly for such a busy place, so special mention just had to be made of it."},{"date":"2015-04-18","rating":"5.0","review":"A great place to eat with friends! Definitely a popular spot; outdoor seating closes kinda early, so indoor is all you get. Indoor has a great atmosphere, but pretty loud. The various times I have come here, I ordered: rattlesnake and rabbit, rabbit and pork, buffalo, and the Austin blues. All of them are delicious, but if you want spicy, get the rattlesnake or the rabbit and pork. Can't go wrong with the toppings.Beer selection is quite nice. I always get the Franziskaner weissbier (5%, $6), or the Bitburger pilsner (4.5%, $6). Both very tasty.If you're gonna go all out, get the large fries (Groot), and with the truffle oil glaze. Amaze-balls."},{"date":"2015-05-20","rating":"5.0","review":"I have gone here many times and have tried different beers, never disappointed!

Us three amigos decided to have a sausage fest. Not the Silverlake kind but rather the Wurstküche  kind.I love sausages!  Ok there I said it!  And I love this place with the name no one can pronounce! yelp.com/biz_photos/wurs…Sausages, I love them all big, small, white, red, brown, spicy, BBQ, plain, Italian, Dodger, Chinese, German, Polish,  Portuguese, Mexican, Filipino, smoked, grilled, breakfast, skinless, venison, chicken, beef, turkey, pork, blood, mystery meat, cheese filled, summer, patties, wurst, knock, bock, natural case, hot links, salami, boerewors, chorizo, bangers, andouille,  bologna, linguica, or any of the hundreds of other variations. In fact I've never met one I didn't like!At 11pm as we pulled up the place was pumpin' out sausages and beats to a full house with a line out the door. I was pleasantly surprised by the quickness the line moved. One minute I'm out side the next I'm in front of the sausage counter yelp.com/user_local_phot… then I'm gettin' flipped off by one of the cooks  yelp.com/user_local_phot… LOL really I chopped off his peace sign. And in a couple more minutes I had ordered and was holding a nice cold Spaaten yelp.com/biz_photos/wurs… and heading to the dining room in the back. I was immediately struck by the hipster crowd packed in to the room having a great time. This ain't your parents Wiener-schnitzel this is a sausage eatin' beer drinkin party folks. DJ spinning and the DTLA youth scene in full effect!  yelp.com/user_local_phot…  yelp.com/biz_photos/wurs… I really dig this place except for the horrible music the DJ was spinning! Techno scrambled with the carpenters. Really?? WTF? BARF!FOOD: We each ordered a couple different wienies and shared. Sorry for the crummy pics.Bock-worst: who doesn't love a nice Veal & Pork white sausage with some kraut and spicy mustard. 4.5****Starsyelp.com/user_local_phot…Hot Italian: My fav! I'm always a fan of Italian sausages, toss on some peppers and onions and I got your back all night long. This was a damn good Sausage! 5*****Starsyelp.com/user_local_phot…Duck, Bacon & Jalapeno: Exotic for sure but not the spiciest (mild) of the bunch, still the peppers added to the nice pop this one had. 4****Starsyelp.com/user_local_phot…Crocodile & Pork Andouille:  This exotic surprised me with its taste. The sausage was very nicely spiced and sure to be a favorite of all that try it. Nice pop on this one as well.  I'm a big Crocodile fan so I really liked this one. 4.5****StarsSun Dried Tomato and Mozzarella: Smoked chicken and turkey was not my fav but still like all the others it was a solid dawg. 3.5***StarsDan also ordered some fries and I think I ate most of them and I loved 'em with the Blue cheese walnut bacon dip. OMG that stuff should be illegal! It was so effin good! The fries looked dark and burnt. Nope double cooked to perfection and were some of the best fries I've had in a long time! 5*****StarsAll I want to know is when they gonna open a Wurstküche in my hood? The packing house has plenty of room! Just say'n.  Hey you Wurstküche dudes paying attention?What's  Wurstküche? Its when you reach down between your dates legs and find a sausage. That's the worst coochie. LOLI'll be back for sure! They made a fan out of me!"},{"date":"2015-12-17","rating":"5.0","review":"Blanche Beer!!!

I had hyped it up in my head based on all the reviews but I usually don't even like sausages/hot dogs that much. I thought this place would blow me away and would have me craving it over and over but I guess I don't know how to really appreciate good sausages. It's nice to try but nothing super memorable I need to come back for. PARKING: Have to look for street parking nearby for free parking but there is a small parking lot down the street on the right for a couple of restaurants if you are ok with paying like $3. ATMOSPHERE: Order when you walk in at a counter and you see all the sausages they have on display. Then walk down this long hallway with your number to either indoor or outdoor seating area. There are a couple of small tables along the edge and outside but mostly there are super long tables like in a school cafeteria in the middle. PRICE: Each hot dog I would say is about $6-8.FOOD: I ordered the duck and bacon sausage and the rabbit, veal, and pork. Despite the jalapenos they were not spicy so no worries my fellow weaklings. Both were good but nothing amazing. I had to keep switching between the two with my bf because I kind of got bored with the taste after a couple of bites and wanted to switch. If I had to pick my favorite of the two it would be the duck and bacon. The spices and flavors were definitely unique though but not satisfying for me. The grilled onions on top were nice and a good complement though. Truffle fries were good but I don't really like natural cut fries. Peach soda was amazing and the fruity beer was pretty goof too without much alcohol flavor.  I don't think I'd come back because it's not my cup of tea I guess. Probably with a good beer and on a hot day certain people would enjoy this but for me I prefer more rich flavors and tastes."},{"date":"2015-02-24","rating":"5.0","review":"Another absolutely satisfying trip to Wurstkuche!! We love this place. The food never disappoints. The reason for this update is to shout to the world that they brought Lamb back!!! It may not be the most exotic of the exotic choices, but the flavor is SOOOOO GOOOOD!!! i actually think it's my favorite. I remembered it being good before, but man I think the flavor may even have gotten better since the last time I had it. they give you two sausages in one bun when you order the Lamb because the size of one sausage is smaller than the average size of some of your other options. I definitely recommend trying the Lamb when you come...at least once. Also, does anyone have any recommendations for beers to try??? I am stuck on my two favorites Eisbock and La Trappe. I was going to try a new one when we were there but I chickened out and resorted to my tried and trues. If you have any recommendations, please let me know!!"},{"date":"2015-07-20","rating":"5.0","review":"Great selection of imported beers on tap, clean bar, friendly staff and really good German sausages.

Keep in mind they don't have hard liquor, Just beer and wine."},{"date":"2014-06-07","rating":"5.0","review":"A name of an establishment that I find kind of difficult to pronounce sure makes up for it in their eats! This establishment has one of the most reviews by fellow yelpers. That is what tempted me to go try this place out for myself. That and the fact that they had a variety of sausages to choose from. Wurstkuche is a German restaurant that is famously known for their exotic sausages. It is located in the so called Hipsterville area of Los Angeles. There are a variety of art shops and stores nearby, so this place is sure to be frequented by arts students, hipsters, etc! I came here earlier in the afternoon wanting to try this place and finally cross it off my bucket list. Mind that I am not a big hot dog fan. Personally, I have never been crazy nor have had any interest in them at all. Their wide variety of sausages here made me change my mind. They have quite the variety, the rattlesnake and rabbit wurst being their most popular. So I went with that and a small order of Klein fries as well. As for the side sauces, I went with the Chipotle aioli, which gave the fries somewhat of an unusual kick but very tasty. The rattlesnake and rabbit sausage had some spicyness to it, especially with the sweet peppers and red bell pepper slices that came on top of it, but made for an excellent choice. The fries were crisp and made just right and very warm. As for the drinks, because I was quite medicated, I had to forgo on alcohol, instead opting for a San Pellegrino. They do have quite a variety of German brews on tap, most of which I will try at a later visit. As for the inside, well, it is not the fanciest looking. There are wooden tables and seats, somewhat resembling an old school mess hall. Seats can be very limited on a packed day or night. I managed to sit at the far end near the exit. They do have complimentary water as well near the exit, as well as utensils and napkins. This place can get quite loud with people chatting or the music that is being played overhead. So, what do I think overall of Wurstkuche? It did leave me quite impressed, especially with their exotic sausage flavors and their amazing fries. The interior was ehh! The pricing of the food is very reasonable. For all I ordered, it came out to $15 flat. The gentrification that has came to be about in this area has made quite a significant yet amazing change. This establishment is one that is sure to be around for quite a long time. And I will definitely be returning very soon because Wurstkuche, well, you did leave me quite impressed and will be looking forward to trying more of your exotic sausages and your amazing German brews...next time I will forgo my meds just to have myself a Warnsteiner here!! Enjoy, fellow Yelpers!

Wrong. Try a gourmet hot dog with cooked toppings along with those delicious Belgian (aka double fried) fries. I try to get something different every time I come here, but I'm still not ready to try the \"exotic\" flavors yet haha. I usually like an even bun to sausage ratio, but since they're gourmet...you'll get more bun. I get caramelized onions and sauerkraut as my toppings, which sounds weird, but they work quite well together! All the sauces for the Belgian fries are delicious, so choose depending on your mood ;) They also have almost every type of mustard you can imagine for condiments as well as regular ketchup. You can also order beer while standing in line once you get past the door before you get to the cashier! I also love the vibe of the dining area (some communal tables) and they even have a DJ at night, so be prepared to shout across the table. On a date? Go here for dinner, across the street to the Pie Hole for dessert and down the block for some arcade games at Eighty-Two. There! Easy night out :)The bad news:The line here is always out the door and down the block, and even though it moves fairly fast...doesn't help the hangry people out there.

We had an open tab at the bar and when we went to the counter to pay for our food, she told us they could charge our food to the bar tab, which is awesome!

Most likely you'll have to find a lot and pay.This place can get packed. When I came there was a good 15 minute to order and another maybe 15 minutes for the food to come. The seating area was packed as well, we had to wait for a spot to open and got seating at the bar.Food selection is great, all sorts of meats, lot of beers to choose from. Nothing too pricey, if you order fries you get a lot.My favorite was the duck hot dog.Lots of fun places to hang out nearby within walking distance (pie hole, angel city brewery, eightytwo the arcade bar etc)."},{"date":"2014-05-25","rating":"4.0","review":"I love this place for the ambience, the beer selection, and of course-the food. The only reason it is not receiving 5 stars is because most of their sausages contain pork, which I recently stopped eating since scientific evidence proves eating pork causes premature memory loss. I ordered the chicken apple sausage with spices. Which I'm waiting to eat as I write this review. I expect it to be nothing less then delicious, but if it's not, I'll update my review to share the details."},{"date":"2014-05-02","rating":"5.0","review":"Review # 695!!!! 700 here I come =)I got the predator and prey sausage here!Do not read this review expecting double entendres! Awwwwww! I know you want to hear about \"sausage parties\" but.... LOL....Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapenyo Peppers - $7.50I imagined the snake slithering around my stomach trying to get the rabbit all the while I was digesting them haha! However, it didn't really cause a war in my tummy - it caused sheer delight! The sausage was amazingly great and so were the Belgian fries. I washed it all down with water. Thank you to the fabulous Phillip N. for treating me =) They have classic, gourmet and exotic sausages.Usually there is a long line to get in here but we came here at the right time and avoided it.The dining area is like a mess hall so get used to sitting next to strangers. The food is so good you just won't care - even if you are the greatest misanthrope. I know beer and sausages go together, and they have a great variety of beers here, but still I didn't have any.The Arts District was relatively unknown until recently. Places like Wurstkuche and The Pie Hole have changed that and the new megagigantic apartment complex called One Santa Fe nearby is going to make things even worse. Parking wasn't so difficult a while back but now it is sheer hell. Get ready to drive around and around till someone leaves. There is a lot nearby but you have to pay there.I love this place because I get to practice my German LOL - which I studied at UCSB. The word Wurstkuche means \"sausage kitchen\". I love to hear people try to pronounce it - especially my BF haha. It should be pronounced vuwst-kuu-he. Wurst should be pronounced like you have a potato in your mouth.The ch should sound like it does in the name Corey CHaim LOL. Some people pronounce it with an sh sound but it drives me up the wall even though parts of Germany do indeed pronounce it that way."},{"date":"2015-04-24","rating":"4.0","review":"Their wide selection of exotic sausages caught my attention, and the great taste of them made me a fan. The place is very \"hip\" and a lot of people just go there to mingle, but if you're looking for a good sausage, you've found the place. Don't come expecting it to be as cheap as a hotdog stand, these are way worth the price you pay for them.

The line is always out the door which is usually a good sign and their beer selection is top notch. I always get the Belgium beer (Blanche De Bruxelles, $7) because it's light yet tasty, it comes in a small glass so if you want something in a bigger glass, get the hef (Franziskaner).My favorite sausage is the Louisiana Hot Link, there is a definite kick (spice) to it. Today I decided to try the Santa Fe Jack Cheese & Jalapeno Peppers which is made with smoked turkey meat and it was absolutely amazing. You can add 2 toppings which are included in the price, I got caramelized onions and sweet peppers (bell peppers).  I am a french fry addict and their Belgium double dipped fries reminds me of the fries I had out in Europe...and you get to choose from an array of dipping sauces. I enjoyed the chipotle ketchup and my dad loved the buttermilk ranch, he was even dipping his sausage in it. I love the beer hall feel straight out of Germany. You place your order in one room, they give you a number, you go to the back through a long hallway and grab a seat, most are communal.  Make sure to grab your favorite mustard to put on your meat/bread. The whole grain is my favorite but it's all a matter of preference. On a side note, they have very good looking workers which makes the experience that much better. There is no parking lot, you just have to find street parking. It's a hop, skip and a jump from Little Tokyo so you can head over there for dessert or you can walk across the street to Pie Hole."},{"date":"2015-01-02","rating":"4.0","review":"This is one of the best hot dog venues in the LA district. The ambience gives off a cool hipster vibe. It really added to the experience. I appreciated the cashier who spent the time to help me pick out which hot dog was the best and which toppings are good for a particular dog. But let's get onto the food. I ordered the classic bratwurst and 3 exotic hot dogs. If I could have only one hot dog, it would definitely be the bratwurst. The exotic dogs that I tried (duck and bacon, rattlesnake and rabbit, buffalo beef and pork) all had interesting flavors but felt slightly on the drier side. I also ordered fries which were sized like steak fries and I recommend the blue cheese dip. All of the food I had was enjoyable and much better than any hot dog restaurant I've been to before."},{"date":"2014-07-12","rating":"5.0","review":"Unbelievable this place is soo good!!!!! I've driven past it so many times when I go to pie hole and the line has always been out the door. So today I decided that I needed to come try this. When you walk in the staff immediately greets you and gets you a drink! I first got the apple bear and it was amazing! I shared the duck sausage, kielbasa, and the hot link. They were all so good. The hot link wasn't as special as I thought it would be. But I would recommend trying the exotic sausages... Why not since you're already there?! The Belgian fries were good, truffle oil is a must! The pesto mayo and the chipotle aioli dipping sauce were good! Overall it was an amazing experience and I will be going back often!"},{"date":"2015-02-02","rating":"4.0","review":"Definitely a unique place to visit! They guys behind the counter are very helpful in describing their selection! I stopped in on the way out back to the Bay Area for some munchies for the road. We ordered the rattlesnake and the rabbit sausage as well as their belgian fries. I thought both were good but nothing particularly different. It was nice to try something out of your usual hot links and etc. Their belgian fries are so addicting. They offer so many different sauces but I was quite happy with the belgian fries on their own! I'd like to pop in again for a dine in experience so I can fully enjoy my meal."},{"date":"2014-07-24","rating":"3.0","review":"This Hot Dog Kitchen was very Hipster the food was Okay.note: not all Brats or \"hot dogs\" have the same size not all buns are in perfect condition .good fast service.expensive beer and crafted Sodas.Electronic music playing by a DJ ,( stereotypical ) (Annoying In my personal preference.)

My friend and I stopped in for an early dinner. Original Bratwurst: The bratwurst itself was tender and moist with great spices adding lots of flavor. The bun had nice grill marks on it adding a smoky flavor. It was topped with grilled onions and we got peppers on the side. Paired really well with the spicy mustard!Santa Fe Jack Cheese and Jalapeño: The sausage itself had a thick casing that had a bite to it. It packed some heat and was very flavorful. This was also served on a grilled bun and topped with onions. Belgian Fries: These were some of the best fries I've ever had! They were piping hot, fried ALMOST to the point of too fried. Had a crisp bite and soft insides. There are lots of different sauces to choose from, but we got the chipotle aioli and the pesto mayo. The variety of mustards were also fun to experiment."},{"date":"2014-05-20","rating":"4.0","review":"As far as food is concerned, this is the second most reviewed place in Los Angeles, and that's saying a lot. What else is there to be said? With 5700 reviews and an average of 4 stars, it's a place to go, and try. The lines were long on a saturday night. I think we waited about 30-40 minutes to be sat. Once you get inside, they serve you drinks while you browse the menu. They also offer samples of some of sausages. They have a ton of regular and exotic selections of meats and great not good beer from Germany and Belgium. I had the rattlesnake and rabbit with belgian fries. Do note that the sizes are small, and you won't get full off of one, they're about the size of regular hot dogs. The beers are rather large though, pay attention to the size and ABV listed next them on the menu. The back area is like a picnic style place with a full beer bar.

They're thick but crispy and you get to dip them in a variety of sauces. Yum! and beer? There are so many choices! Nowadays, you can find unique and craft beers everywhere, but I think this spot was definitely one of the first places to introduce me to all the choices out there.  Inside it's a chill, non-fuss, dimmed lighting, loud music, good for group setting. It can get pretty crowded so you'll have to squeeze in with others on a busy night. There is an outdoor area too, but I kinda like the vibe inside better. Overall: Must try, must visit. At least once. And get the fries."},{"date":"2013-07-05","rating":"4.0","review":"I am biased. Yes. If I like sausages in general, i would give it five stars.

Equally large selection of European beers (I love the Franziskaner).Their fries are Belgium, which are great, and they have about a dozen dipping sauces.The setup is you wait in line to order (which can take anywhere from 10 min to 60 min), and then they have a large beer garden in the back where you sit, picnic table style, and they bring out your food. It's fun, a tad hipster, and a great meal.Insider tip - Parking isn't easy, so let your guests out of the car early to get in line while you're trying to find parking."},{"date":"2014-12-06","rating":"5.0","review":"A great semi-self serve gastro-pub!

For all ya'll struggling with it. Trust me, I know :p We were also skeptical after we asked an employee who claimed it was pronounced \"worst-kuka.\" Uhmm..? Lol. I've only been here a couple of times, but I love everything about it- the food, the beers, location, ambiance, etc. There is a huge selection of sausages to choose from, so if you wanna pass on the gourmet selections they also have some classic choices too. I've tried the Rattlesnake + Rabbit, the Gator + Pork, and the Duck + Bacon-- all were very tasty and delicious. The only thing about the Gator + Pork, for me, was that the casing was a little too thick. Regardless, I'd order it again, because it also has some spice. Don't forget to try the Truffle Fries & all the sauces you can. We had the Garlic Aioli and Pesto Mayo and (of course) loved both. I've only tried a few selections of beers, but my favorite so far is the Chimay White. For all the non-beer drinkers, I'd suggest trying the Früli (strawberry beer that tastes almost like a wine cooler). The dining/bar area has an awesome social vibe, which makes the experience here that much better. It's a great place to go to start your night out with a group of friends."},{"date":"2014-05-17","rating":"4.0","review":"I love this place! It has a very modern take on German beer house. You walk in and order your food and walk around the back and you find a seat on benches like those you would find at a beerfest you'll probably be sharing with complete strangers (they're strangers at first, but they'll probably become friends through the night). There's a bar area too where you can order many craft beers. I've tried the duck, bacon with jalapeños sausage and the mango jalapeño sausage. Both were very delicious and flavorful, my only complaint is that the roll that it is served on is a little overbearing for the sausage. I always get the sweet peppers and caramelized onions to top the sausage. The fries are pretty good too, they are steak fries, and I usually prefer shoestring, but the fries serve as a great vessel for the array of sauces you can choose from. My favorite sauce was the chipotle aioli. I've also tried the pesto mayo, curry ketchup, and the tzatziki sauce. My least favorite was tzatziki because it was too mild for the fries. I tried many beers one night I was here, but I remember my favorite was the Pauwel Kwak. It's served in a glass with a wooden handle.This place is very fun and a very great start for your night!

Also, the bar inside had no line so I had my girlfriend but me a chamay white $8 for .25L to enjoy while in line. If you don't come with someone else, the host will ask you if you want to order a beer once the line makes itself inside the building.After a quick 20 minute wait we split a large fries with chipotle aioli and house buttermilk ranch and a bockwurst with sauerkraut and carmalized onions. Everything came out to perfection. At the table you have a choice of a plethora of mustards. I enjoyed a liter of German Franziskaner heffe weizen. The beer came frosty from the tap and was unbelievably crisp and delicious. The beer me back another $12 and tip.

I'm not a fan of their freshly baked buns, they are super soft. Some of you might like like that but I don't. I only like freshly baked bread from actual restaurants. This one just feels diluted in some way, airy, foamed up. The sausages were just like whatever too. Maybe the ratios were off. You ask for 2 toppings and they throw them on there for you. The sausages are not big. An LA street hotdog is like 5 times better than any of the hotdogs I tried here. If you get a street hotdog you get the bacon, mayo, grilled onions, a grilled jalapeno and regular bread (It's not freshly baked but it doesn't feel like a damn sponge). A street hotdog is like 5 bucks on a busy night, this place sells the hotdogs for 7 bucks and up.  I wouldn't recommend this place unless you want to eat a hotdog and drink a beer at the same time. Also, when I went, they had a DJ. They have outside seating.  Another thing, their fries. They sucked. I'm not big on salt but these fries tasted like they had none. You get a dipping of choice with your fries. I picked chipotle ketchup but I couldn't taste any of the chipotle.  I had high expectations of this place because the times I've passed through there they always have a long line. Why do people like this place? I don't know. Maybe they've never had a LA street hot dog. Even a costco hotdog is better than one from here, at least price wise.  Attire: Wear a stupid bowtie and suspenders."},{"date":"2014-06-21","rating":"4.0","review":"I personally don't really like crowded place but overall the food is good especially the Rattlesnake and Duck sausage.

I personally would like it more if it was on a like plate with a good amount of vegetables. Me and my girlfriends tried 7 different kinds of sausage.To us the best sausages were the classics:Kielbasa, bratwurst and bockwurst.For the fancier one:The best was the filipino sausage and the sun dried tomati and mozzarella. I didnt like the rattlesnake and rabbit - the meat was too strong in flavor for me and too salty for my taste. The duck with bacon and rabbit with veal was also just OK...

Ever since I moved down here from the Bay Area, I've been searching for a world class 'hot link' to compete with Berkeley's 'hot link'. Finally after months of searching I have found my SoCal Top Dog. I ordered the hot link and it was exactly how a hot link should be... HOT! I've been to Pink's and tried their hot link and to my surprise it was not good, decent at best. This place is the real dog. They have every type of hot dog. If you're in the area and want a great, delicious hot dog is say come to this place. The only downside, but I'm ok with it, is the price. TopDog prices their dogs at $3 and I usually get two. Here one dog with toppings adds to about $8-$10 dollars which isn't bad! Definitely one of the best places I have been to in LA! The vibe is super laid back and don't forget to order beer. They have some killer selection. Also, a rare thing to see was three solid options for vegetarians. My two vegetarian friends feasted on their dogs and said they were the best they had ever had. Vegetarians know how hard it is to find a veggie dog.

Vegetarian options are available however that's never gonna happen for me!  An assortment of mustards are on each table.Food was outstanding - two toppings are included, I went with the sweet peppers and the hot peppers. (other choices are caramelized onions and sauerkraut) I was lucky to enjoy this place with some fellow Yelpers, we ordered a few different sausages each - then cut them up and shared - a great way to try several items! I checked their prices against my local place for brats (Mattern Meats) - prices are comparable for the Classic wursts - prices climb for the Gourmet and Exotics portion of the menu - but that's to be expected, and was not a problem for me! Enjoyed everything I tried: Classic Bratwurst was very good; Austin Blues -hot and spicy, tri-pepper & hardwood smoked pork from the Gourmet Menu; and from the Exotics menu - Duck & Bacon With Jalapeño Peppers; Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned With White Wine; and Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapeño Peppers. The last one had me wondering - could you feed jalapeños to a  rabbit, feed the rabbit to a rattlesnake then kill it to make the sausage? These are they types of thoughts you have when hanging out with Roy B.Shared some fries - the dipping sauces are the star of the show - especially the Bleu Cheese Walnut And Bacon - a table favorite.Best value in the place - a pint of PBR for $3 - That was my choice - and I was high fived by several at the bar for making it! I think Roy was a little bummed when he got his wine glass size, half foam 8 dollar whatever it was.Community tables and benches make for a friendly place, I would have liked the option to get a pitcher of beer - but I hear the place gets very crowded later in the evening and it seems like a good place to hang out - so pitchers not be a good idea.Would be a regular if they opened one of these in North OC!!"},{"date":"2014-03-18","rating":"5.0","review":"The best sausage I've ever had! that's what she saidddd! ha!Food: 5/5Drinks: 5/5 Vibe: hipster I came in with a group, most of us were from Texas and the rest lives in LA area.

I'm a french fries kind of girl and their fries did not disappoint! Goes well with the chipotle aoli sauce. I didn't like the chipotle ketchup sauce. I was actually contemplating between the duck and rabbit or rattlesnake and rabbit sausage before decided on duck. I was too chicken to eat rattlesnake. Too chicken to eat the whole thing but I still wanted to try it so I took a bite out of my friend's rattlesnake and rabbit sausage. LOL it was firm. There was a crunch when you bite into the sausage. Now I can say I ate snakes once. They offer a good variety of beer and sodas. If you don't find anything you want to drink then you my friend, are high maintenance. The crowds was a mix.

After ordering, if you go down the hallway, it leads to a nice, roomy (hidden) beer hall.  Brick walls, industrial, and old school, with a bar and bartender.  Nice atmosphere.For the food, I had the Bratwurst with sauerkraut and Sun-dried tomatoes with Mozzarella,  Curiosity Cola, and Belgium Fries.  Both were quite flavorful with a pleasant kick.  The bratwurst was nice and meaty and  Sun-dried tomatoes with Mozzarella has a nice, slightly sweeter flavor. There are various choices of mustard on each table--the Dijon has the biggest kick.   Excellent Belgium fries...nicely seasoned and crispy.  Located within the art district, there is street parking.  Remember to watch your meters as my parking ticket (yesterday) was $63.00 as of this writing.  A group of 2-4 should fit fine.  Sausages are tasty, somewhat pricey, but they're meaty and the old style beer hall definitely kicks it up a notch."},{"date":"2015-03-23","rating":"4.0","review":"I am a bit biased because I'm not crazy about brats; however, I will say that if I am feeling like eating bratwurst, this is my default.  I love being able to just get in line, order my brat (with toppings), order my fries (with dips) and then get my beer, and take a seat outside on the patio.  This place is in such a great area to view any art installments that are occurring across the street.  If you can find parking, it's ideal (and usually it's not hard to find SOME KIND of parking either on the street or a couple of blocks down).  Prices for drinks are a little up there, but it is the Arts District and it is LA.  Cool vibes, live DJs, great patio area (this area can get a little cramped, so if you have more than 4 or 5 people in your party I would suggest trying to find inside seating)."},{"date":"2013-03-11","rating":"4.0","review":"I want more Belgian fries! I came here for the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage, but the fries singlehandedly stole the show for me. Wurstkuche's fries were so fresh with a crispy outer layer and fluffy potato center. I'd say they are very similar to Slater's fries but better because they were garlicky! Get the fries as a side to whatever sausage you are ordering. You won't regret it. And get chipotle aioli as your dipping sauce. As for the sausages, I tried one of the classics vegetarian smoked apple sage and two of the exotics crocodile and rattlesnake and rabbit. I like how all the sausages are not ordinary in any way. You can't really go wrong on your first visit just randomly picking one off the menu. Of the three, I'd like to try the rattlesnake and rabbit again. I am not too sure if I like it or not. The sausage was moist and juicy. The taste of it though was hard to describe. My taste buds have never tried rattlesnake and rabbit before I guess. I didn't like the crocodile sausage too much because of the thick casing. It was a bit too chewy and dry. Overall, Wurstküche is definitely a nice spot in dtla to hang out with friends with good food and drinks!

I am all about \"the best fries\" so I was down.It's like a ride at an amusement park. There's a long anticipatory wait outside (probably 15 minutes) that is on the verge of being annoying, but the anticipation holds you over until you get in the front door. Once you get in, you are greeted by a server who asks if you want beer. ALWAYS SAY YES (unless you are underage). That beer will make your wait in line the greatest wait in line you will ever have.You'll get hungrier. You will inch closer as you snake around a small, brightly lit room, drinking Weinstephaner Vitus, talking with your friends about how the Vitus is one of the best beers you've ever tasted, and getting excited as you see the raw sausages on display. You may change your mind a few times.You'll order, and you will most certainly order fries WITH the truffle oil. It is mandatory in my opinion.You'll then carry your number and your beer down a long hallway and you will hear a faint, ever growing bass line from what seems to be house music. You turn a corner and you see something you would not expect. It's a huge room with long tables, ANOTHER bar and mustard/ketchup bottles everywhere. There is also a hipster looking DJ.You will then order another beer at the bar, and talk with your friends about how random and crazy this place is and you will be starving. The food will come out and you will eat it and say how bomb it is considering you are slightly buzzed.You will then go back to the bar and order an apple pie ice cream sandwich. You'll ask to quarter it so that you can share it easily with your party.You'll then exit through the large door into the cool night and get ready for the rest of your night, probably in J town."},{"date":"2015-08-31","rating":"4.0","review":"It was hot.  They put a tent out on the street in case the line extended that far.  They had a person making sure that all the patrons were familiar with the drill.  Offered beverage service.  I was impressed with the management at that point.  Somehow I have become a vegetarian-ish person and EVEN STILL - I was able to really enjoy myself at this establishment.  Because their buns are made of some secret meat, I'm convinced of it.  They slaughter angels and upon their wings, put whatever fennel / eggplant based approximation of a wiener, and one does not complain, but finds one's heart, filled with celebration.  Hands full of thick steak fries.  Thank you, Wurskuche, thank you curry ketchup."},{"date":"2016-02-17","rating":"4.0","review":"Really tasty place to sit down and enjoy some unique meats."},{"date":"2014-06-30","rating":"3.0","review":"I've been to a lot of concerts in my day, and I've gotta say, the sound levels in Wurstküche nearly paralleled the the jams bouncing off the guitar of any given lead guitarist at a rock concert. For some reason, Wurstcüche thought it would be apropos to have a DJ rockin' away on Father's Day, because what better way to celebrate the dad in your life than with loud pop/indie music and a sausage.Like I mentioned, Yelper Ben Y. and I went to Wurstcüche with his father and grandfather to celebrate Dad's Day. We arrived around 2pm that Sunday and the place was hoppin'. It was packed to the brim and the music was cranked. We could barely hear each other as we waited for our orders, and basically had to repeat everything we said, despite how loud we yelled. The food was good. It wasn't spectacular. I ordered kielbasa with fries. The fries were good, and the kielbasa was pretty good too. Like I said, nothing outstanding. As for the menu, I'll give them an extra star. If you're in the mood for something really strange and exotic, Wurstcüche is your place. There's stuff on the menu that I wouldn't dare try. Same with the beer selection.

I basically used that aioli sauce for my hotdog and fries & demolished however much they gave us. For vegetarians: I tried the Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle with grilled onion and saurkraut. I didn't get a lot of grilled onions, so that kind of sucked. Other than that, the hot dog was really good and spicy! I added BBQ sauce and the orange aioli sauce they provided us with and enjoyed every bite of it! The front cashier told me that these hot dogs are also vegan but the buns are not, so if you're vegan beware. I also tried my friend's Vegetarian Smoked Apple hot dog, and I don't think I liked this one as much. It was rather bland and if it were mine, i would've had to lather it with even more sauces than necessarily. Street parking wasn't too hard to find on a Tuesday night, but I'm assuming it gets a lot worse during the weekends. I'm also assuming it gets a lot more crowded during the weekends as well. It's rather affordable at about $6-7 per hot dog. The seating can be limited if it gets busy. The seats are set up as lunch tables and it's rather dimly lit with a very hipster feel.

I was feeling adventurous so i chose the rattlesnake jalepeno and the pork filipino sausages.  The rattlesnake was good, but felt that the jalepeno overpowered the meat.  Rattlesnake is a lean meat so naturally it was not as juicy as other sausages, but by no means dry.  The filipino was juicy and had a good balance of spices.  The toppings were good (i tried all 4).  The spicy peppers were not too spicy, so it did not hide the flavor of the sausage.  Fries are thick cut belgian style.  They were ok, but a bit darker than I'm used to having.  There are several dipping sauces that i liked more than the fries.  The one to try here is the one that has bacon in it.  I think it is the first one on the menu.  Besides a wide beer selection they also have a unique selection of non alcoholic drinks such as cucumber soda.  It has outdoor seating too which is great on cool night.  Neighborhood is artsy and reminds me of Williamsburg in NYC."},{"date":"2015-02-25","rating":"4.0","review":"Great food!

Once we where a good four people before the check out, he asked if we wanted to order a beer, which was so cool that we had it on our hands before paying.

I'd like my version better.This place is anything but the worst koochie. The discrete entrance leads into a crowded ordering area that leads into a larger, dimly lit dining area full of large communal tables, bars, and a live DJ playing groovalicious nu disco. How awesome is that!?Despite the seemingly long line outside the entrance, we waited a mere 20 minutes on a Saturday evening, 8 PM, during which we efficiently decided on the 5 wieners we wanted to split among 5 ladies (yelp.com/biz_photos/wurs…). Upon entering the building, a waitress took down my friends' beer selections, which they cheerfully sipped on as we got closer to the register. If I knew a bit more about beer, I'd tell you about the excellent selection that they carry...but, quite frankly, I don't know anything, and can tell you nothing.We opted for 1 gourmet sausage ($6.50) and 4 exotic sausages ($8 each) (s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com…). CW from the top left: mango jalapeno, crocodile, rattlesnake, pheasant, rabbit. We tagged on a groot order of BELGIAN FRIES for $5.50, which meant a large portion of fries with a choice of 2 dipping sauces (s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com…).The MANGO JALAPENO consisted of chicken, turkey, and apparently mango, though it tasted more like a spicy sweet chicken apple. The CROCODILE & PORK, ANDOUILLE was hickory smoked with a thick casing that was very tough indeed. It was decent, though there was a strange, unsettling taste that I couldn't quite place. The RATTLESNAKE & RABBIT WITH JALAPENO PEPPERS was mildly spiced and tasted of meatballs to me, whereas my friends said it reminded them of jerky. The PHEASANT WITH HERBS DE PROVENCE came off as a breakfast sausage to me, which I'm not a fan of in the first place. And the RABBIT, VEAL & PORK SEASONED WITH WHITE WINE was my favorite because it tasted the most familiar to me, especially among all these strange flavors :PThe caramelized onions and sweet bell peppers that we picked as hot dog toppings were fantastic. The hot dog bun is nothing outstanding, and neither are the fries. However, the two sauces we ordered are of note. The BLEU CHEESE WALNUT & BACON has generous chunks of fried bacon and feta cheese and was originally my favorite until it began climbing up the salty scale. The PESTO MAYO is delish, as one can imagine. Water and mustard are self-serve.Eating exotic wieners in a rambunctious warehouse while grooving to nu disco?Let me be the first to rename this place Bestkuche."},{"date":"2015-06-18","rating":"5.0","review":"Amazing food.

For example, they have a beer that is brewed by monks!    As we entered, she promptly took our drink orders and got them for us right away.  Within 10 minutes after entering the restaurant, we ordered and went to search for a table.  The tables are organized in cafeteria styles, but there is a really nice patio outside.We like their variety of vegetarian sausages and their truffle fries.  I sometimes get the sausages without the buns so I can save more room for the truffle fries with the awesome dipping sauces.  The blue cheese dipping sauce is my personal favorite.  We were out of there in under one hour and felt very full and happy.  I definitely would recommend this place to all of my friends!"},{"date":"2014-02-11","rating":"5.0","review":"I'm shocked I haven't reviewed Wurstkuche yet, I've been coming for years and recently was back for another outing. From the first time I came about 4 years ago to now, the quality has remained the same, and by same I mean delicious. My favorite has always been the rattlesnake and rabbit. It's juicy and flavorful. Sometimes the exotic meats can be a little dry but not rattlesnake and rabbit. The bun is slightly larger than the link so I end up tearing some off. (hint hint, make bigger links) I never really order the basic sausages like brat or hot links because they don't taste that special to me and I feel you can get the same Whole Foods or something for a fraction of the price. Besides the sausages, the fries are a MUST get. They fry them perfectly to a crisp on the outside and creamy inside. I like the chipotle aioli dipping sauce the best. It's best to come during off peak or for lunch because I feel like it gets too dark and loud at night. Line can take a while during peak hours as well so expect to wait quite a while to order, but once you order it's usually pretty easy to find a seat. Most are big communal tables with butcher paper so just plop down with your food and beer and enjoy!"},{"date":"2014-12-04","rating":"4.0","review":"Incredible hole in the wall sauage joint downtown close to Staples Center and LA Live.

Since I do not consume red meat, I was excited to see other meat and vegetarian options, including a chicken apple sausage. However, they ran out of the it so I settled for the Italian vegetarian sausage with the Belgian fries. The Italian tasted a bit funky and off to me, but it's probably because it was vegetarian. I did expect something more from this purveyor of sausages though.Since I prefer fries of the shoestring, skinny variety, the Belgian fries were also a miss for me): They are cut into thick slices, and the condiments were eh too. Give me plain ol' ketchup instead any day!

I came here with my photography class while we were in the area and we definitely had to try this place.The menu itself was pretty straightforward. Ranges from vegan/vegetarian to exotic sausages. I heard the menu changes from time to time, so I might have to come back.There's indoor and outdoor seating down the hall from the ordering area. The indoor seating consisted of long communal style seating in the center of the room and a few smaller tables scattered about. There's a bar area too if you're in need of a refill.I would suggest getting whatever the most exotic sausage there is at the time of your visit because, let's be honest here, you might as well.It'll cost you around $10-11 for the hot dog and an order of fries."},{"date":"2015-02-01","rating":"5.0","review":"The fries here are delicious!!!

Other times I've been here during the evenings and the lines were out the door, but not this time it was a nice change for once. I tend to be a creature of habit and always order the same thing. I got the mango jalepeño which is a turkey and chicken sausage. With any dog you order you get to choose two toppings. I ordered the caramelized onions and the sweet peppers. There are a total of 4 toppings you can choose. the other two ate spicy peppers or sauerkraut. My toppings added a nice crunch. The peppers had grilled marks. That was so delicious. Like that smokiness taste. I love my veggies grilled. 5/5I also tried the filipino Maharlika, which is a sweet pork sausage. Totally tasted like longuinesa (which is a filipino sausage). This was very juicy. 4/5The other sausage I tried was the rabbit veal and pork seasoned with white wine sauce. This was amaze balls. Definitely a must try, but my fave will always be the mango jalepeño one. The flavors are just so outstanding in this one. 5/5I also ordered the Klein fries, which are like steak fries . The cut is very thick. Seasoned very well and was crunchy and hot. fries are very well made. love me my potatoes!!! With the fries you get to choose one dipping sauce. I chose the curry ketchup which had a nice spice and kick to it. The are a bunch of other dipping sauces such as chipotle aoli, buttermilk ranch, chipotle ketchup, pesto mayo, sweet & sassy bbq, Thai peanut, blue cheese walnut & bacon, sundried tomato mayo, and the tzatziki sauce. Any Additional dipping sauces are 0.75 cents extra. 5/5For my beverages I got Mr. Q cucumber drink. If you guys have never tried this its so refreshing and light. It's like a carbonated drink with a hint if cucumber. Not too sweet at all. I love it. 5/5And got a shantelle beer(sorry totally forgot the name). Very similar to a hefeweizen. This bebr was pretty darn good. Went great with the sausages. 5/5So once you order your meal at the front and pay for it they hand you a number. Grab a seat inside or if you prefer outside seating they have that as well. And the come and bring your order to you. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. Always a wonderful experience here with delicious food and great ambiance. Nice change to come for once when it's not so packed and crowded."},{"date":"2014-01-29","rating":"4.0","review":"I just had to write another review, just for the sole purpose of giving them props for efficiency. If you ever want to place a group order, just call in with a credit card on hand. There's no minimum for ordering to-go, but once you order greater than 12 sausages, they'll put a cap on the variety you can order (no more than 3 types for that order). Once you place your order, they'll give you an estimated time of when your order will be ready. Mine was 15-20 minutes (surprised? I sure was). Go to the back bar when you arrive, pick up your order, pay for it, and off you go! Relatively painless process, even though it was barely past peak lunch hours.Many thanks to the staff at Wurstkuche for the awesome service! Will definitely be back! :)Note:* The darjeeling tea is sold by the bottle (hence the heft $4.50 price tag).

Hubby and I have been going to Little Tokyo for decades and were clueless about the L.A. Arts District and decided to start exploring starting with Wurstküche.  Our maiden voyage went well with us standing in line to get in to order. Once we were in the property line a sweet lady asked us if we would like a beer to start off.  I didn't know what I wanted and after a few probing questions she handed me a Duchess en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du… .  This was now MY beer.  Hubby ordered a Belgium beer as well and was pleased.  This was all about me as I am not normally a beer drinker but this Lambic style beer was Heaven in a glass! When it came time for us to order, we decided on Pheasant with Herbs de Provence and Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers.  You can pick two toppings:Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers, and Spicy Peppers. Gourmet mustards - self serve in the back Whole Grain Dijon, Spicy Brown, Honey Mustard, American Yellow and KetchupWe took our beers to the dining area and was greeted with wood beam ceiling, brick walls, european type seating, some round tables with a benches and a few semi private tables in a room that can be closed off. Both were juicy and delicious.  With the Spicy Brown mustard we slathered on the sausage it was hard to tell what we were consuming.  The fries are extremely good with a nice crunch.  We have been back 5 or 6 times now and when we have Hoshi we sit out on the patio and simply enjoy the DTLA view and relax. Parking can be a bear.  Limited and expensive in the evening.   Here's a little secret, if you just want to come in and order beers, you don't have to wait in line at the front entrance, you can come through the side entrance, order your beers and sit at the bar or any available seating.  Sausages - 5 StarsSelection of beers - 5 StarsBartender - 5 Stars - knowledgeable and asks probing questions to meet your beer needs.

The meat is very, very succulent. Also, you can get an assortment of toppings (sauerkraut, yay!) and ridiculously good sauces if you get fries. Go for the truffle fries - yum! My favorite was the creamy bacon dip (bleu cheese walnut and bacon). The atmosphere is definitely hip - it's wedged into the Art District of DTLA so go figure.

The wait was actually kinda long to order but once we ordered it wasn't hard to find seating at 2pm on a Saturday.  They have long tables and then some smaller ones near the walls.FOOD: You pick what toppings you want (2 of the 4) sweet peppers, spicy peppers, carmelized onions and...maybe one more which I can't remember.Then, you can choose which kind of hot dog you want.  My boyfriend got the rattlesnake and rabbit one and I got to crocodile and pork one.  To be honest, I would say that next time I come I'll get a normal hot dog, the two \"exotic\" ones weren't my cup of tea.  Not because they tasted weird or because of the strange ingredients but because they didn't have that hot dog consistency or taste.  I can't explain it but the texture of the rattlesnake one was kinda strange and then mine was too tough and dry.  I liked the peppers though and they have 4 different types of mustard you can get.The bun was very fresh and slightly toasted, which was nice.We got the belgian fries with the truffle oil and two dipping sauces (tzatziki sauce and the pesto mayo) both very good and refreshing, that truffle oil, even though you have to pay extra for it made it taste extra good.I'm not sure if I'm a complete fan of the belgian fries because they are thicker cut but very fresh and very good.ATMOSPHERE: LOVED it, very trendy, clean, modern, with angled tables and serving dishes, number holders etc.  It has a bar and I heard at night they have a DJ so very lively.  A fun, airy, place to go with friends or family.Definitely worth checking out, if you just want to say you tried the exotic meats say it but if you don't care, I say got with a normal dog."},{"date":"2014-11-05","rating":"3.0","review":"This restaurant only serves \"brats\" but they do have an eclectic selection including pheasant, rattlesnake and others.  Choose a brat, a topping (e.g. sweet peppers) and decide if you'd like Belgian-style fries (again with a variety of dipping sauces).  The brats and fries are excellent.Beers are German or Belgian only.  Imports only.  In other words, don't look for anything hoppy like an IPA.  Or anything local.All beers are served in proper glassware.There is no table service.  You need to stand in line to order - often a long slow-moving line which can be a drag - but on a good day they will bring you a beer while you wait.Seating is on long communal tables with large plastic squeeze bottles of various mustards at hand.It seems the goal was to be like an authentic German gasthaus (the restaurant name is German) but it falls a bit short."},{"date":"2014-02-19","rating":"4.0","review":"We had a difficult time finding the entrance during our first visit here...we ended up walking through the back entrance and into the bar. There is a young, hipster, chill vibe to the place. We seemed so lost because we didn't know where to order nor where to sit. It's a communal-style seating arrangement with long benches. Don't be scrubs like us, and ask random people where to order. The main entrance is right across The Pie Hole, and you order there (there'll be a glass case full of wieners). After ordering, go to the back and seat yourselves. I've tried the Crocodile & Pork Andouille, Lamb w/ Mediterranean Spices, and Rattlesnake & Rabbit w/ Jalapeno Peppers. I always top it with Caramelized Onions and Spicy Peppers. Croc & Pork: the sausage was pretty tough and chewy. The flavor was really good, but the texture was off-putting. Lamb w/ Mediterranean Spices: it was really juicy and packed w/ flavor. I liked this more than the croc sausage. Rattlesnake & Rabbit: this was my favorite one! The sausage was lean and tender. Be adventurous and eat a snake!Overall, this spot has various exotic and \"normal\" sausages that is worth giving a try. Adding one (or a combo) of the four mustards they have on top makes the sausage better. Also, pair it w/ one of their Belgian/German beers. I would come back and try something else, but at a random time to avoid the line."},{"date":"2016-01-21","rating":"5.0","review":"Awesome place!

Sure, both tasted great, but I probably won't stand in line for it again, especially since it definitely was NOT the BEST brat i've ever had.

The Frulie strawberry beer was very sweet and tasty and good for people like me who aren't crazy into beer. On things other than food, the girl who was supervising the line was kind of annoying and rude. The back room where people sit down to eat was also far too dark.

Unlike Pinks who try to hide their sausages through copious amounts of toppings, Wurstuche likes to keep its sausage center stage by offering a few simple toppings such as peppers and grilled onions. This is a great place for adventurous eaters and yes the rattlesnake and rabbit is a must try. For those non meat eaters they also have you covered with vegetarian options. Also a big plus here are the fries and the dipping sauce they offer with the fries! Oh not to mention they do have a pretty good beer selection which is truly a must for a hot dog place like this. It's one of LA's most popular eating spots for a reason guys! Check it out. Also the location is great because its right by the middle of LA's art district. Walk around and enjoy the art after stuffing your face and drinking some beers."},{"date":"2014-12-31","rating":"3.0","review":"Went to this place the other day. The food was just ok. Mediocre at best. I could've bought some Hill shire Farms sausage and fooled myself. Even an Oscar Mayer would've been sufficient but I guess it's the experience. Get here early  because the place fills up quite quickly. I had VIP parking but I think it's because I got there before they even opened. The service was good though. One thing I must mention is that they don't say that a piece of hair is always included in there French fries. It was fried quite well so I didn't mind too much. I figured with the condiments they have table side that it would help the hair go down a little easier. I informed them of the hair and they brought out another tray of potatoes, hairless. One would think that the hairy fries would have made the hairless fries complimentary but I was mistaken. If anyone likes hairy fries this is the place for you. For sausage go to your refrigerator.

The sausages are right by where you order, you can see them before they are cooked. My favorite is the mango jalapeño sausage. Don't forget to order fries! They will kill you with deliciousness. Not to mention I detested mustard before trying their mustard sauces at the table. the beers are so good, They have different glasses for each. Once you order they give you a number and you walk around to the back through a longish dark hall.There's some small tables but for the most part the tables are huge long ones where you are forced to sit next to people you don't know.

Man such good fries.I got da Kielbasa. It came hot on a warmly toasted bun with sauerkraut and hot peppers--delish! I love it when food comes out hot. Order at a small bar/area room, then walk through the hall into a larger area. You have to pick your own seat, but I love the space! High ceilings, another separate bar area if you want to get another drink, noisy but not too noisy.Parking: metered street..but this location is in a very hipster area so you can go to other places nearby. We went to Pie Hole across the street.I don't know why I liked this place so much but I did. I know I could technically just get a hot dog at Costco for $1.50 but still!

There's often a long line to order, but once you've done that there's a lot of seating in the back seating and bar area.I got myself the Brat and Crocodile & Pork, Andouille. I also got fries with a few sauces... you must get the Thai Peanut sauce. It's actually a very normal condiment for fries in europe and it's about the best, in my opinion. The Brat was great and the Crocodile... well it didn't really have a distinct flavor and was pretty much beat out by the Brat.I'd definitely come back and try some more stuff."},{"date":"2015-01-30","rating":"5.0","review":"Ok.

The list could go one.One of the gentleman stood by and helped us in selecting the yummiest ones. We ended up with a rabbit and white one I believe and the other was a spicy duck. We topped the duck with sauerkraut and onion and the rabbit with spicy peppers and onion. They were delicious! I give them four stars only because they were too small for the bun. I really wish the toppings didn't take over the size of the sausage.We also shared their fries and now I wish we each got a large. Those things were awesome! It's been a long time since I've had fries and I'm glad I waited for these ones to break my celibacy. We dipped them in ketchup, some kind of aioli, brown mustard, their mayo concoction with bacon (THE BOMB), and their tomato basil one.I honestly could have ate them off the floor.

Is that a lame thing to deduct a star for? I have tried three of the different sausages and they are good. I don't think I would have the rattlesnake one again, it wasn't worth it.

This place does bratwurst and beer the real German way (based on my very limited German knowledge). You walk in, and the moment you step inside, someone greets you and asks what you'd like to drink, pointing to their list of ~30 beers, mostly German and Belgian. They all have authentic-sounding German names, because as far as I can tell, they are all imported or something. German beers can come in liters (a stein) for twice the cost (usual serving is 1/2 liter), and a $20 deposit to make sure you return the stein. They offer you beer as soon as you step in because they know you'll be waiting a little while, standing (25 minutes for us) to order your bratwurst, fries, or dessert. They have three categories of bratwursts, general: regular kinds, vegetarian included, gourmet: i don't remember, but better sounding, and exotic: including rattlesnake, rabbit, pheasant, etc, for $6 general, $6.50 gourmet, and $8 exotic. you have 4 options for toppings, any 2 are complimentary. These include caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, and spicy peppers. There are four mustard options to top it with as well. The fries were perfect. Decent amount, perfectly cooked, exquisitely seasoned. Two sizes. I haven't tried their dessert yet, but I've never been a fan of German desserts (yes, even German chocolate cake). Regardless, I need to try it again, based on their other foods. We went on a Friday night, which explains the wait, but it also explains the awesome DJ that was playing at, surprisingly, a volume that wasn't blasting my ears off. I will certainly be returning, the only question is when, and with how many friends."},{"date":"2014-05-28","rating":"5.0","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here last week.

I even abandoned the bacon walnut aioli dipping sauce that came with my fries, opting to use the honey mustard instead.

I actually met Skrillex here once randomly. Parking 2/5Sucks. All street parking. Best of luck to you.Wait time 3/5Very inconsistent. Come here on a Monday night and there are 3 people ahead of you. Come here on a Friday night and the line goes down the street. Then again I've seen long lines on weekdays as well. It all depends on how bad you want the sausage....no pun intended.Ambience 4/5Seating can be a b$%tch at times. If you don't get a small table (shaped like coffins), you'll be sitting at the beer garden style picnic tables and benches. I think it adds to the atmosphere. On weekends they have a DJ on the \"1s and 2s\". There is a bar in the seating area so you don't have to keep coming back to the front to order beer.Service 4/5Servers here are really nice. People at the counter are very knowledgeable with sausages and beer. Servers in the seating area are also very nice and hip.Beer 5/5Great selection of Belgian and German beers on tap and by the bottle. I usually just go with Belgians. Favorite Belgians on Tap:La Chouffe - Golden AleLa Trappe - Trappist quadrupelSt. Bernardus - QuadrupelFavorite Belgians by the bottle:Delirium Tremens - Belgian strong ale (My favorite ever.)Kwak - AmberRochefort 10 - Trappist quadrupelFood 4/5So many different sausages to choose from. One day I will try them all. Plenty of vegetarian and some vegan options, but they cook on the same grill....If you're picky about that....sorry? You can get your choice of Caramelized onions, sweet peppers, hot peppers, and sauerkraut on top. Belgian fries are always a good choice as well.The sausages (pronounced Sohs-wah-jez) I've had:Chicken Apple & Spices - Quite tasty, and since this sausage is smaller, you get two in one bun.Austin Blues - Similar to a hot link. Not badFilipino Maharlika - Doesn't taste like longanisa. I've never had a sausage in the Philippines called Maharlika....strange.Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers - Juicy!Rattlesnake & Rabbit with jalapeno peppers - Very mild flavor. Compliment with whole grain mustardCrocodile & Pork - The casing is really tough on this guy. You've been warned.Overall 4/5Great sausages. If you can get over the crappy parking situation and long line, it's not a bad spot to hang with friends.

Look  i have no clue what the boy friend ordered me but its the 2nd one from the menu and it comes in a cup with a little man winnie sticking out...... Delicious.... Yes this is a very hispter place but your in the art district so live with it..... Also that Underberg that you see at the cashier .... If you have someone you hate in your life buy them the shot....

Handed a menu from one of the employees that was standing on the street. He was super helpful with the different items on the menu and the beer selection. Once you cross through the door, you're able to order alcohol! So for the 5-10 minute wait in the front end of the restaurant, everyone is enjoying a cold one. Because I went with such a big group, I was able to try almost every sausage they offered. ALL DELICIOUS! The indoor eating area is communal style, with a walk-up bar. Outside seating is  minimal and they have broken up tables, so you aren't elbow to elbow with a fellow sausage lover."},{"date":"2012-12-16","rating":"4.0","review":"Still unsure if I know how to pronounce the name correctly, but what the heck. I've been wanting to try this place out for a very long time. I must admit I'm not not the biggest beer fan, nor do I care for sausage that much.  However. Wurstkuche is a must try on my list since they're more than just sausage and beer, they actually go above and beyond for new exciting flavors and exotic combination. When I arrived around 7:30 on a Sunday night with a friend, we got really luck cause there was barely a line. They have a wide selections of different kind of sausages ranging from the norm to the not so standard rattlesnake and such fillings.The Food:-Buffalo, Beef & Pork with Chipotle Peppers. With Caramelized onions (a must) and spicy peppers (yum)!I must say, the sausage was super juicy and delicious on the inside. It's normal sized, not too big and not too small. To be completely honest, with all the flavors meshed all together I really couldn't really taste all the distinct flavors. That in conjunction with the veggies on top, the overall sausage experience was good, but I can't say that the flavors were  amazing. I wish it had more of a kick to it, the spice really didn't shine through.-Alligator & Pork Andouille SauageDidn't taste like alligator, not that i'm too sure what alligator distinctly taste like. One again, all the flavors just blended together. Very juicy as usual. -Belgian FriesOMG love love love LOVED these. My friend and I shared a large. Personally i'm a fan of thick cut fatty crispy fries and these were exactly it! They hit the spot, and the dipping sauce, oh the dipping sauces. I tried the Bleu Cheese Walnut & Bacon and the Chipotle Aioli. Orgasmic in my opinion.The Drinks-Strawberry BeerI'm not a beer drinking kinda girl and was actually not going to get any. Well my friend was adamant that I try at least one beer...so he got me the girliest one.. and man was it delicious. It tasted more like a strawberry cider than beer. It was light and refreshing and it went perfectly with the heaviness of the meal.So Final verdict?Four stars? Why? Well, although the flavors of the sausages didn't blow me out of the waters, I do praise them for having so many exotic flavor combinations to choose from. Also, their Belgian fries are just to die for. Moreover, if you're a beer loving fan, this place will be heaven for you. On another note, just the overall atmosphere was lovely here. Big communal tables, dim lighting, dj playing--great place for catching up with friends.OH i forgot to mention they have self served homemade mustard on each table! yummo!I definitely will return to try the other flavors."},{"date":"2015-02-12","rating":"4.0","review":"Came here for the first time...the line wasn't long when I got there on a tuesday night...they offered beer while you wait on line, which is cool...they have different glasswares for different beers which is cool....sausages was good...I enjoyed the duck and bacon one and the snake and rabbit one....the mediterranean for me was just meh.... beers i ordered were delicious and ice cold....the ice cream sandwich dessert was so good !! seating is unique...it's like a mess hall where you have to find where you want to seat...but overall it's cool...different...great place to hangout...not so much for a romantic date...fries was delicious....not much of a difference between the small and large size...and not much of a difference if you get truffle oil (which is $2) extra and without.....they're still good...."},{"date":"2014-09-11","rating":"4.0","review":"Cool spot for a German beer in downtown, I've been here twice, once on a date and the next with my sis, both times were to have a couple of drinks.

There's a case full of different sausages you can choose from and they cook them there for you. The seating is community, there are a couple of tables off to the side if you can snatch one. Both times I've been I have received good customer service.

It's located in the Arts District of DTLA, near Little Tokyo. There's free street parking if you can find it, metered parking, and $5 lots around.When I walked in, there was a decent sized line, but it moves pretty quick. An employee was standing at the entrance to had out menus as we walked in and ask if we'd like any drinks while we waited. I ended up getting the rattlesnake & rabbit sausage (comes w/ two free toppings) and an order of the fries.The sausage had a really good flavor, I enjoyed it. I would totally order it again -- or maybe try another exotic sausage on the menu. The fries on the other hand, were kind of a disappointment. For all the hype I saw on Yelp, I thought they'd be amazing. But, they really just tasted like normal fries to me. My order came with two sauces included and I tried the chipotle aioli and the BBQ. They were pretty solid, but I really wish we had gotten more sauce with our order. I like to douse my fries in sauce. and there just wasn't enough for me.Pricing was a little on the higher side. My sausage and fries cost $15.

Tried rattlesnake, wasn't too bad but at times it felt too chewy. Other hot dogs are solid as well, however nothing is amazing. Their side order items (fries, sweet potato fries, and etc) are your standard items. I usually stick kielbasa which is always solid. Great beer selection. I think their wide variety of beer selection is what draws people here in the first place. Cashiers are usually super chill and they let you taste beer if you aren't sure about which one to pick.  It is a tad bit loud but it has a chill ambiance, especially if you're out with your friends.

Fitting that it is located in my favorite neighborhood in LA! This is the perfect place to go if you're visiting town, hosting friends, or if you and a big group of friends want to go somewhere to relax. It can get especially packed during dinner time, and I've seen a long line out of the door several times starting at 10 or 11 pm. But with the way it's set up with lining up to order and then finding a table, the flow usually works so that you can find a table. I typically don't have any issue getting a table with friends and I've gone at busy and slow times.Now... as for the food! YUM!!!!!! All of the exotic 'brats are great! I've tried a few of them but I'm pretty settled on the 'Rattlesnack & Rabbit' because it has just the right amount of spice for me! A close second is the 'Mango Jalapeno' again because of a perfect amount of spice, but also with the mango twist. I HIGHLY encourage you to get a side of truffle fries to go with whichever 'brat you pick! PLEASE DO! Even if you're not that hungry, split it with a friend or two. The fries are some of the best I've ever had! I'm a chipotle lover so I also accompany the fries with Chipotle Aioli or Chipotle Ketchup (or both).I usually don't go for the beers because my favorite place to drink (Angel City Brewery) is right down the street.

Surprisingly to my tastebuds, there was little to no aftertaste.  The rattlesnake had a nice amount of heat to it from the jalapenos, and the addition of rabbit gave it a nice balance.We ate up at the front in the cash register area as the music in the main area was too loud for us (it was almost midnight) to have a conversation."},{"date":"2014-03-09","rating":"3.0","review":"I have to qualify this review: (Am not a big fan of processed German food).This is a great late night place to get some sort of gut bomb when starving.

Two of us shared two hotdogs: (1) a mango jalapeño dog with caramelized onions and sweet peppers, and (2) a sun-dried tomato and mozzarella dog with sauerkraut and sweet peppers.  Both had a chicken and turkey base, and both were easily the most delicious hotdogs I've ever come across.  We also shared a large (\"groot\") side of Belgian-style hand-cut fries, which were cooked to a perfect crisp.  Even better were the dipping sauces -- we had the tzatziki as well as the bleu cheese walnut and bacon.  (If you've never tried dipping your fries in tzatziki -- do it!  You can thank me later.)  There's also abundant bottles of free mustards and ketchup on all the tables.  Wurstküche is hotdog heaven.  Trust me -- one bite and you'll be smitten, just like I was."},{"date":"2014-10-20","rating":"3.0","review":"We live by the Lincoln location and go there often...

Damn this is some good sausage. The sausage casing has a crunch/bite to it, which all good sausage should. It was grilled perfectly with a seared exterior, awesome. The sausage itself is a meaty-sweet, juicy, charred, smoky deliciousness with a tiny kick. My favorite sausage there so far. So much flavor in a small package. The bun is housemade & fresh. It's light, airy texture with a slightly toasted exterior. I like this bun a lot. We got sauerkraut & sweet peppers with this one which gives it a refreshing sweet twist. They have ketchup or two different kinds of mustard at the table. Didn't need it, it's that good.-Duck & Bacon (5*) w/Jalapeno. Such a good sausage. Strong hints of bacon, you can also sense the duck. It's also juicy with smoky, meaty-sweet, bacon-saltiness flavors. All meld in good ways. The bacon flavor is not overpowering at all. It's just right where it lets other flavors stand out as well. My wife's favorite out of the two. I love both, but my vote is for the rattlesnake above. This was topped with caramelized onions & sauerkraut. The sweetness of the sauerkraut & caramelized onions go very well with the saltiness of the bacon flavor. Not much of a kick even though there are jalapenos in the sausage, but very delicious nevertheless.-Belgian Fries (5*) w/Truffle Oil. You can tell these were double dipped fried (just like it says on the menu). Dark brown in color, crispy outside & mushy soft inside. Hints of truffle. Delicious. Got the Chipotle Aioli, very good dipping sauce. We can eat these all day but if you're on the health kick, then perhaps ease up. Or don't try them at all because once you eat one, you won't be able to stop yourself afterwards. Be forewarned, these are addictingly not good for you. At least we'll die happy. =)-Sweet Blossom (5*) soda. It was recommended by a very knowledgeable employee that was there to answer questions regarding their sausages, food & drinks. As she said, it is a refreshing drink. Sweet but not too sweet. It's carbonated, just like how the wifey likes it. Can't describe the flavor but it's got hints of honey maybe. It's just good. Try it."},{"date":"2015-08-09","rating":"5.0","review":"Food here is great!

It is a mix of exotic sausages and classic German bratwursts. The exterior design of bricks looks amazing and the interior has a fancy nice modern feel. And the food is amazing!  The bratwursts are cooked perfectly and I come here all the time.  The only thing is the service is a touch slow but the amazing food definitely makes up for it. They also have a amazing selection of imported beers, and an amazing vegetarian selection for not meat eaters (for a bratwurst restaurant that is impressive). This is the best bratwurst restauraunt I have ever been to and their exotic sausages bring a whole new meaning to the word bratwurst.

Thoroughly impressed. Here's why:The service:All of the wait staff were attentive, kind, helpful, and happy. It's as if they actually enjoy being there, and they are glad that you are there. They offered suggestions, assisted with the ordering process, and were über kind to my children. Throughout the meal, servers dropped by the table to check on us. The ambiance:This is a beautifully designed urban space. It's inviting, and beckons you to stay. It's lit almost entirely by natural sunlight. The food:My family ordered the Rattlesnake and Rabbit, the Lamb, the Duck and Bacon and the Chicken and Apple sausages, along with a couple of orders of Belgian fries. My family loved everything (we divvied). The sausages are delicious, flavorful, and satisfying. A lot of love goes into making 'em. The fries are life-changing. They're double-fried, so they have the right amount of crisp (in my subjective opinion). You get a choice of dipping sauces. Love the Thai Peanut sauce. Excellent experience. We shall return.

I was with my artist friend (not an aspiring artist, mind you, girlfriend gets paid) and decided to go to the Arts District. I think my heart flipped when I saw they had Duchesse on tap, among others, but Duchesse!I ordered the snake and rabbit sausage and put peppers on it. It was a really light flavor, nothing special. I just had yet to cross snake off my list of animals that aren't safe from my plate.We shared the fries, which were good, that came with two sauces. She picked pesto, I picked the blue cheese. I was unimpressed by the blue cheese sauce. I think it should have been stronger. Would I go back? Sure, if the line wasn't long like it was when we were leaving. We only waited about 5-10 minutes.

The Kielbasa is pretty good, too.My preferred topping set are caramelized onions and sweet peppers. I greatly appreciate the variety of available mustards - my favorites are Dijon and honey mustard. Sweet & Sassy BBQ sauce is a solid choice to go with the fries.The staff is generally pretty cool to deal with, although during my first visit, the cashier was somewhat of a dick.This place can be insanely packed with customers even on a weeknight.

However, Tonight was a special occasion because a special Hawaiian honored us with his presence. We cut loose and spent the big bucks on the EXOTICS plus one Gourmet Filipino! We couldn't decide on what toppings to put, so we just told them to surprise us. Easiest ordering ever. Usually, when I think of sausages, I think of a variety of meats that mix together. I am often skeptical of whether the meat i ordered was actually in the sausage. It seems to easy to mask the true tastes. This time around we taste tested 6 sausages amongst 3 guys to prove which one was tastiest and which one ripped us off. MY RESULTS: BEST TO WORST Pheasant with Herbs de Provence - Dense, chicken like. Clean. I think we have a winner, winner, pheasant dinner!Rabbit + Pork with Leeks and Carrots - Light, flavorful. I liked it. I tried the rabbit leg at 'Animal' and thought I could taste the rabbit in this as well. Did not make me feel ripped off. Lucky rabbit foot I tell you. Filipino Maharlika - Nice, sweet, and smooth. Renamed the 'Filipino My heart like aah!'Duck and Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers - I think the bacon over powers the duck. I searched for the duck flavor but I couldn't really find it. Off to Chinatown I go.Buffalo, Beef and Pork w Chipotle Peppers - Good but had a few chunks of fat in it. Had to spit it out. Spitting out chunks of fat isn't very exotic or sexy. RattleSnake + Rabbit + Jalapeno Peppers - Smelled kinda funny. This was the only sausage I voluntarily put mustard on to mask the flavor... Totally rattled my insides.There you have it, 3 Guys... 6 sausages"},{"date":"2014-12-06","rating":"5.0","review":"My buddy who lives in the city took me here.

I should have gone with my initial choice of the veggie apple, but that just means I'll order that next time around.

Only what they offered in their menu and that it must be delicious since they create lines that go down the block! I have no cool friends to tell me what to order or what to expect so I went with an open mind. The line was long but I've been in longer. They ask what you would like to drink at the door. They give you your beer but by the time you're sitting with your food you need a new drink! (clever, very clever)Food is ordered and paid for first.After paying they give you a number and tell you to go sit down. I walked down a dark hallway and when I turned the corner, my biggest fear! It's a mess hall. Have you ever been standing with a tray of food in the doorway of a mess hall? Suddenly I was back to being a weird nerd; looking around desperately trying to find a table. I can't sit with the cool kids, I can't sit with the pretty girls or the jocks. Heart pumping! Where can I squeeze unnoticed?!This was the feeling I had. I'm still not as cool, pretty or sporty. I found a gap in a bench and quickly sat down trying to be invisible. The food came and I enjoyed eating my hot Italian. It was delicious but I was still an awkward little girl while sitting there.

We've had alligator before at La Fondue Restaurant in Saratoga, CA but never as a hot dog. I thought that it was perfect and really delicious.

I've never had rattlesnake before and was worried on how it would taste... It tasted just like chicken. haha I couldn't tell the difference between rabbit or Rattlesnake. I thought it was delicious!! I would recommend this to anyone who is feeling adventurous with food. haha---Belgian Fries with Bleu Cheese Walnut And Bacon and Pesto Mayo:I thought fries by itself was BOMB! it was thick fries. You can tell that it was made from scratch because at the end of the fries there were still some skin on them. I thought that was genius!! The Bleu cheese walnut was perfection. It tasted more like Bleu Cheese than anything else though.. The Pesto Mayo was a great combination. I would have ever guess that those two would make a great combination. Both sauces were perfect and complimented the Belgian fries very well.They also sell beer here. I think they are distinct to this location but Im not sure.

A huge seating area hides in the back of this little shop, like a modern snowboarder's lodge, complete with built in vinyl turntables and full bar.Normal hot dog flavors run about $6 and the exotic flavors are about $8. The fries here are steak cut and pretty delicious. I usually don't care for steak fries but these really worked.The Dogs - It's actually hard to describe them all individually. In the end, they kinda taste the same with fixings but I'll try to give you a feel for them.*Pheasant - A salted flavor, this particular sausage is fairly light and easy to digest.*Duck - The meat is a little tougher, not in a bad way. Just feels heftier on each bite.*Snake & Rabbit - If you can get your mind past what this is, it's pretty tasty.

I ordered for our office staff and I was very delighted to hear that they take phone orders for takeout. Three of us had rattlesnake & rabbit w/ caramelized onions and sauerkraut. We were all hoping the hotdogs were bigger but we were all very satisfied with our meal. The only sausage that we didn't love was the vegetarian sausage, which was dry.  We also loved the sauces for the fries. Our favorites were chipotle aioli and curry ketchup. When I brought our order back to the office, we noticed that the drinks were missing. When I called, the manager actually offered to drive them over but it wasn't worth the trouble, so he refunded me the difference and sent me a very nice email with the updated copy of the receipt. I definitely want to go back and try some other sausages!"},{"date":"2013-11-16","rating":"5.0","review":"Wow!

The line wasn't ridiculously long, but it was at least a twenty minute wait. Apparently, there is a lot of hype about this place, and I've never even heard of it. I lived in LA most of my life, lived in West LA for 5 years, so I'm a little surprised. When we got inside, while still in line, one of their employees took our drink order, which was nice while we're still waiting. I ordered the Vetus, or Vitus, or however you spell it, reminded me a lot like a Stella Artois as far as the light clean crisp flavor. When it was my turn, I ordered the Rattlesnake and Rabbit, which according to the other people in the line, was a crowd favorite. I also ordered the fries, which chipotle ketchup. As we waited for the order, we went around to the back and looked for a seat. The place was packed and there wasn't any place to sit. Luckily, the waiters/waitresses placed two tables for my friends and I to sit next to the DJ, which was really nice of them to accommodate us while their at full capacity. (We obviously had to tip them for their service). When it came down to the food, the Rattlesnake and Rabbit was good, but it wasn't anything extraordinary. I've definitely had better. I was quite frankly, disappointed, since it was hyped up so much. I tasted the fries, and oh my god, the fries like melted in your mouth. It was nicely seasoned and the dip complimented the fries well. I loved it. And I'm usually not a big particular fan of the big fries, I prefer the shoe strings fries more, but this is something that will bring me back."},{"date":"2015-07-06","rating":"5.0","review":"Wurstkuche has an excellent selection of sausages and beer.

My friend and I arrived a little past 1pm on a Sunday afternoon and the line moved quickly and I definitely appreciated the young lady who was expediting the line. She did an outstanding job. She let me taste different beers because I am not generally a fan of 'Belgian' beers, and I definitely appreciate that. I settled with the Old Rasputin Imperial Stout (one of my all-time favs), and it definitely did not disappoint.Onto their food. I followed previous reviews and ordered the rattlesnake and rabbit which was 8$ and my friend and I shared the fries.  The fries were amazing! I loved how crispy and salty it was without being too greasy. We had the pesto sauce which was amazing! I definitely recommend it!As for the hotdog, it was good...I'm just not sure if it lived up to all of the hype from other reviewers. I appreciated that it didn't taste gamey at all. And I can finally say that I ate rabbit and rattlesnake. I just don't think it was the best hot dog I've ever had. It was damn good, just not the best. On the bright side, I love how organized and fast the service was and was impressed with the ambiance of the joint.

There are sooooo many sausage selections from vegetarian to exotic. I've tried the famous rabbit & rattlesnake (SO SAVORY MM~~), the duck and bacon (didn't really like this one... sorta on the oily side), and the mango jalepeno (chicken and turkey...loved this one!! slightly sweet but with a kick because of the jalepenos MMMMmMMMMMm). You get two toppings with your hot dog and the grilled onions + spicy peppers are the best. The belgian fries are addicting and they come with one dipping sauce if you get a small and two sauces if you get a large. The chipotle aioli, pesto mayo, and sundried tomato mayo are my favorites!!! The thai peanut one is alright... but not my fave. There are also different kinds of mustard (honey mustard, regular, dijon, spicy brown, and I forgot the other one).

The large patio in the back has brick walls, coffin shaped tables, long communal wood tables, turntables set up for DJs and a bar. The refrigerated case had about 21 kinds of sausages including classics, vegetarian, gourmet and exotic sausages (made out of crocodile, rattlesnake, pheasant, rabbit, etc.). Sausages come with your choice of two toppings: caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers and spicy peppers. Add your own mustard (they have five kinds). They also have double dipped Belgian fries with housemade dipping sauces, Belgian beer and other beverages.* Exotic duck & bacon with jalapeno peppers sausage ($8): The warm grilled white roll was chewier and of better quality than the usual hot dog bun. The grilled sausage wasn't huge but it was big on flavor and very juicy. Though the sausage had jalapenos it didn't seem spicy. I really liked the mellow, warm sauerkraut and sweet caramelized onions.  * Belgian fries ($3.50 for a small comes w/ your choice of dipping sauce) with tzakiki: hot thick fries that weren't that crispy despite being double fried, they were on the soft side and reminded me of steak fries. The tzakiki was thick, creamy, cooling...I liked the yogurt flavor but thought it would be better with more spices"},{"date":"2014-10-27","rating":"4.0","review":"Alright.

It was pretty good. Juicy and flavorful. Yum. Fries were good..the blue  cheese and bacon dip was amazing (i love bacon). Overall, would go again but not something i neeeed to have.

Wurstkuche is a full sensory experience and worth checking out even if you're not a hot dog lover (I'm with you). It's the kind of hipster chic place that attracts friendly, good-looking young couples for a casual-but-not-trashy date night. Enter through the Traction Ave entrance (there's a good amount of street parking on 3rd St) to order and then proceed to the back seating area. If you only want drinks (no food), you can order directly from the bar at the 3rd St entrance.We opted for one \"normal\" meat + one exotic meat option. You get a choice of two toppings out of three (sweet peppers, spicy peppers, sauerkraut, caramelized onions); the sweet peppers were our favorite. You can pick up bottles of mustard and ketchup in the dining area. We were worried about the spice level of both sausages, but neither turned out spicy:- Austin Blues ($6.50): My friend is a fan of Wurstkuche and recommended this one. This was sweeter and smokier than I expected, in the best way possible.- Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers ($8): I've had snake and rabbit one other time in my life, but in sausage form, it's difficult to taste the difference between different types of meat. If you told me this was seasoned/flavored pork or beef, I would have believed you, but maybe my palate isn't refined enough. I wouldn't say this is a bad choice, but we definitely liked the Austin Blues a lot more.- Belgian Fries ($3.50/small, $5.50/large) with Chipotle Aioli ($0.75/dip): The cashiers try to encourage you to order a large for two people, but honestly a small was more than enough carbs for the two of us. I was a bit disappointed because the fries aren't particularly crispy or well-flavored, but the chipotle aioli was good.- Toasted Apple Pie Ice Cream Sandwich ($4.50): You can pick this up at the back bar after you finish your hot food. The couple in front of us recommended this over The Pie Hole across the street. It comes pre-prepared, pre-frozen, so don't expect fresh hot cookies. There was a live DJ in the eating area and a good amount of communal and private tables. The decor is very polygonal (down to the number signs) and echoes modern German design. Service is very very friendly and attentive even though this isn't a traditional sit-down restaurant; the table next to us received the wrong order and two or three servers came to personally apologize."},{"date":"2014-09-16","rating":"4.0","review":"The first time I stepped into the dining area of Wurstkuche it was like walking into a hipster cafeteria.If you sport a newsboy cap, Herschel backpack, or handlebar mustache you are guaranteed to enjoy Wurstkuche's wide selection of beers and eccentric variety of gourmet sausages.

The guys who were taking our order (someone takes your drink order while you're in line) were really nice and helpful--we were deciding between a few things, and they offered great recommendations. We weren't too hungry, so we shared a mango jalapeno and fries between the two of us. My sister said the mango jalapeno was the BEST and I was skeptical because it's a chicken/turkey hot dog (the beef/pork ones sounded really good!) and I thought it might be too sweet because of the mango, but it was delicious! A perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  You get 2 toppings (choose from sauerkraut, spicy peppers, sweet peppers, & caramelized onions)--we chose sauerkraut and spicy peppers and loved it. Once you grab your number, you make your way to the back and they'll bring your order out to you. You can sit wherever you can find open seats (inside or outside)--it's pretty dark inside and has a bar/pub feel. On the tables, there are bottles of condiments galore (ketchup & lots of different types of mustards: whole grain, dijon, spicy brown mustard, American mustard).  Oh yeah ... the fries are AMAZING!

I was determined to eat the Rattlesnake and Bunny (well, I think they call it Rabbit as it's more politically correct to eat rabbits and not bunnies). I heard there is always a long wait so I was prepared for a line.Parking was hard to find and I didn't want to pay $5 to park in the lot so we ended up parking 2 blocks down and walking. There was a very short line of maybe 2-3 parties ahead of us so it wasn't bad at all. A girl came up and asked if we were drinking. She then checked my ID and got me my beer so I could start drinking while I was waiting in line. That was awesome.The place has a very distinct sausage house smell. It's like that smell of casing cooking that can be a little overwhelming. I ordered the Franziskaner, which is a German Hefeweizen. It was fruity and delicious. One of my friends and I shared the Rattlesnake/Rabbit and the Duck/Bacon sausages. We ordered tons of the white truffle oil fries to share.I tried every kind of mustard and my favorite was the whole grain. The rattlesnake/rabbit was over-spiced in my opinion and isn't very juicy. I preferred the duck/bacon much more. The fries were by far the best part. It was a thick cut Belgian fries and the white truffle oil was delicious. We got to pick the dipping sauce but honestly, nothing beat the regular ketchup.I will definitely be back. Next time I'll try their regular Bratwurst or the Spicy Italian.

But for some reason I never ventured here till now, even though the rattlesnake and Rabbit was calling out to my curious stomach for a very long time.To be honest, the sausage was MEH. If it were a taste test, I would not be able to tell it was gourmet, it basically tasted like your average indistinct flavored meat. I scarfed it down without much notice as to what I was even eating. But what i did like was the wide array of Belgian and German beers available on tap! They know their beers and had a great selection :) The houblon was aces! They also have bottled cider, and an apple ale which I'm not sure is gluten free (in case anyone is GF... but then again you probably shouldnt be at a beer place :)I came on a weekday with friends after work so it wasn't TOO crowded, although I did wait in a pretty long line to order my food. There was actually plenty of seating in the back available, and it wasn't as loud as I had prepared for or was warned about. It's quite a nice place to chill out when it's half empty! Not sure if I would come here much more often as I really just wanted to see what all the sausage hype was about, and didn't think it quite lived up. If it does get crowded and loud on the weekends, I wouldn't spend my time in line for average food.I do like the Arts District though, and a good German beer brings back fond memories and there were a couple I wanted to try, so I may end up here again unintentionally one day.

The sausage had pretty good flavor, but the bread was cool and dry. The onions and peppers on top were obviously made in big batches and left out for a long time. There's no sauce, so I added ketchup. But that didn't really go well with the duck sausage. Just couldn't save it.The fries were ok. I had high hopes for these, but I was disappointed. They were too salty for me. I had to wipe it off on my napkin. But the worst part was that they weren't crispy on the outside. A fry that's not crispy should be a crime. My boyfriend has been here before and said we just came on a bad day. Too bad.To add insult to injury, the place smells. I can't explain it. It just smelled weird and made me feel nauseous.

An associate came over to me to apologize about the wait (apparently, the rabbit and rattlesnake I ordered from my fiancé was dropped on the floor from the grill.) I should be irked, but they gave me a coupon to come back and get the Belgian fries for FREE! I like free :)After a 25-minute drive home, the sausages and the belgian fries with truffle oil and chipotle aioli still tasted great!

The first time I came here, my bf and I didn't even realize there was a whole dining area if you go through the hall way. I thought it was just a small little hole in the wall where people just stand and eat or take it to go. When we first stepped into the dining area, I was in awe. The DJ was playing hip hop music, good brew, and they even have STEINS!!!! Although it is a $20 deposit to get one, its just so awesome that this place has STEINS!

A bit steeper than I expected, but I figured these must be extraordinary sausages.  After I sat down with orders in the corner who were already there, my order came pretty soon.  The sausages were a bit over grilled, and tasted nothing special compared to any other sausages I've had before so I conclude most people must either liked the vegetarian choices more, or they are better enjoyed with the vast choices of toppings.  The fries were incredible!  Especially with the dips.  Music was awesome and service pretty good.  There are lots of other places to hang out at afterwards.  For a Sunday, it wasn't bad at all.  Looking forward to go back with a group of 6-8 people, again, sometime later to try other sausages they have to offer :-)"},{"date":"2014-08-26","rating":"3.0","review":"Words cannot express the stress I experienced upon looking at the prices on the menu for a beer, fries and a hot dog (although my friend continually reminded me it was a sausage, not a hot dog).I ordered the rattlesnake HOTDOG and headed into the weirdly cave-like interior.

I guess it's that I love hot dogs so sausage seems to be the natural progression. The service was great. As soon as we walked we were greeted and given menus. Now, there are a lot of options. Try something different like that alligator or something. I opted for the Chicken Apple Sausage and I was not disappointed at all. When it came out it was delicious. The roll they used (oh no, it wasn't some ratchet hot dog bun) was soft but stood up to the sausage and the onions and peppers and the mustard that was loaded on top of it. Yea, I coulda used commas but I wanted to make sure you (the hungry reader) got a full scope of what popped off here. When you first walk in, the place looks small but when you walk towards the back there's a whole indoor beer garden. Meaning, it feels like you're in an outdoor beer garden but you're indoors. And there's even a bar back there so if you want more beer you don't have to go all the way up front. They really thought of everything!AND MAKE SURE YOU GET FRIES!!!!And to top it off, Wurstkuche is in The Arts District which is one of the coolest neighborhoods I've been in.

This is a German and Belgian beer joint and while all of the taps are really great beers, none are hard to find and they hardly ever rotate.I have had mixed experiences.

To start you need a great bun. Wurstkuche's buns are a soft, sturdy, and flavorful ground floor for you weenie. The sausages themselves are moist and packed with taste. The classic \"first\" one to get is the rattlesnake and rabbit. The duck and bacon is also great. I'm sure they're all great. Next up is condiments. Peppepers, onions, sauerkraut, mustard...wow. So many types of mustard, too! For sides I've only had the Belgian truffle fries which are some of the best french fries I've had. They're thick, but not too potato-y. Not too much truffle oil (which can at times be noxious, but it's fine here), and some incredible dipping sauces. My favorite is the bleu cheese walnut and bacon. The environment is one of my favorite parts of Wurstkuche. Long wooden picnic tables with parchment paper over them. If you're lucky there will be some cool drawings from the more talented customers. Their beers are a good selection of German and Belgians. Pretty much something for everyone, from quads to pilsners to Belgian IPAs.

Wurstkuche/\"worst coochie\" offers an incredible selection of exotic, gourmet sausages & this place is definitely worth the experience....once, at least!The restaurant setting is like a typical Irish or German pub. Upon entering, you order at the counter, pay, get your order number, walk down this hallway which opens up to the spacious dining room & then they bring your food to you. It's open bench seating, so you'll be sharing tables with other parties. Have fun mingling and perhaps, strike up conversations with friendly LA folks! I came here with a group of friends and we had a good, drunken time. The wait time to order took about 20 mins and it took me forever to decide on a wurst since there were so many options!! I become indecisive whenever I have to choose something from a seemingly endless list! I finally settled on the Rattlesnake and Rabbit with jalapeno peppers because i wanted to try something totally unique (made me a bit sad because I kinda adore snakes and rabbits!). Also ordered a side of Belgian fries with the wurst. Damn, the fries were addicting!!! Loved them with the chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup! The wurst was tasty with a spicy kick!!

I guess you gotta do what you gotta do for some bomb sausages right?So I decided to go with the Filipino Maharlika with carmelized onions and sauerkraut after careful consideration. I was thinking about getting the exotic sausages since you can't get that elsewhere but the description for the Filipino said \"sweet pork\" and I was ding ding ding sold!!! I love a hint of sweetness with my pork mmm mmm. And I gotta say I made the right decision because it was absolutely delicious!! My boyfriend got the Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapeno Peppers sausage with double carmelized onions. I tried a few bites of his sausage (ha ha ha) and I didn't like it as much as mine. Probably because I was imagining the little bunny I was eating... Just kidding. But I didn't think the flavor was as special as the Filipino. Their fries are absolutely delicious!!! It comes with two sauces. I picked the curry ketchup and chipotle aioli. I was extremely excited for the curry ketchup because I've been in love with it since the first time I've had it with some dino nuggets at my friend's house. But sadly it's about $10 for a bottle on Amazon so I haven't had it ever since (can't get myself to spend 10 bucks on a bottle of ketchup).

First of all, it has a divey vibe--most everything is encased in wood and the lighting is dark, probably like the beers they serve.  The ordering area is separated from the dining area, which has both extremely long tables (frequently reserved) and smaller, more intimate ones.  Where to sit?  The options are endless.   There are so many choices for everything here that should you be indecisive, like me, you'll literally spend your entire night choosing what to order.  The variety of everything here almost guarantees that nobody will ever get the exact same meal as you, hence the hipster vibe.There are so many choices for everything here that should you be indecisive, like me, you'll literally spend your entire night choosing what to order.  If I had my graphing calculator on me, I could perform a few functions using the MATH button and be able to tell you exactly how many combinations of meal/seating/drink you could potentially get at Wurstküche.  But since I don't, I can only describe the menu and offer you an idea of what those combinations could look like.Firstly, the sausages:  They offer sausages in three categories: classics, gourmet, or exotics.  Classics include your bratwurst or Italian or vegetarian sausages, of which there are 6 total options.  Gourmet include interesting blends of meat, aromatics, and flavorings.  However, in my opinion, the real party starts when you reach the exotic meat menu: you can choose duck, bacon, veal, pheasant, lamb, rattlesnake, rabbit, alligator, or bison, among others.  I had the rattlesnake and rabbit, which was surprisingly rich with a kick, and tasted great.Then, if the type of sausage wasn't a hard enough decision, you have the toppings.  You can choose between sauerkraut, caramelized onions, sweet roasted, or spicy peppers.  WHICH ARE ALL AMAZING.Don't forget to add a fries to your order to complete a sausage sandwich meal!  These fries are honestly to die for, so good thing there's only one kind: Belgian fries.  It's relieving to have them make up your mind for once--BUT WAIT.  They offer infinity and one different dipping sauces to choose from, that range from pesto mayo to chipotle aioli to curried ketchup to peanut and other sorts of tangy concoctions.  I've tried all of them (but can't remember the specific names to most of them) and will say that the aioli is my favorite, although they are all excellent.And if your meal itself wasn't difficult enough to order already, don't forget that you need something to wash down all that food.  You can select a drink among the beers offered, but I really think that if you're feeling adventurous, you should try something from the equally exotic selection of imported European sodas: cucumber, mint, cherry, ginger, dandelion, burdock, elderflower, sarsaparilla, and a few more that I can't recall.  I had the vanilla cream, which literally tasted like whipped cream in soda form.  SO GOOD.By the time I finally sat down, I was already dog tired from making so many decisions while ordering--good thing service was slow enough for me to take a brief power nap before meeting my dinner.  However, if you still needed even more variety just so you can be all the more hipster, Wurstküche also offers SIX different types of mustard.  I personally recommend the whole grain mustard, which is nothing like what I've ever had before.  The mustard did it for me--it was the restaurant's knockout punch, and I was officially exhausted.It's already hard enough for me to choose an Instagram filter--how was I supposed to survive making all the ordering decisions at Wurstküche?  There were just WAY too many options to choose from.  This place is the wurst."},{"date":"2014-10-07","rating":"2.0","review":"Went here for the first time and may be the final time.

It actually tastes like a gourmet sausage (like the staff often advertises)- Fries: Their fries are great, especially with the chipotle mayo!They don't have a full bar but their beer selection is great! AND they do have a gluten-free beer if that's your thing!- Spaten Optimator: I usually like porters and dark beers so this obviously seemed appropriate. Doppelbock!

Although most parties keep to themselves, there is that opportunity to talk to a stranger! That's all I ask for. _parking:Parking is tough here. You kind of have to just get lucky; just don't be up all night.At the moment I rate this place an \"A-OK\" and feel that it's a bit overrated.

Everyone wanted to make sure that I'd gotten my receipt, which I really, really appreciated! My friend and I tried the Kielbasa (soooo good), the Vegetarian Italian Sausage (very good) and the Mango Jalapeno (only good if you like mango). We also got the belgian fries with curry ketchup (soooo good) and chipotle ketchup (good). This is a staple place that I will always want to take a friend if they've never been before.

I got the buffalo but I must say, if you are excited about trying exotic meats, you shouldn't eat it in sausage form. It's hard to get the true taste and texture of the meat. I got a sausage, small fries and a beer for almost $20. A little high for my taste.When we went to go sit down, it's a little awkward when it's crowded and you squeeze your way onto the bench at the communal table. For a little while, we were standing, just trying to figure out where to sit.Overall, the food was decent and it's great to go with a group of friends. Not a place for you if you want to go to a quiet, intimate spot.

I still enjoyed my pheasant as it's no ordinary hotdog. Ps. I hate hotdogs but I really wanted to try this place out.

I'm serious. If you enter from 3rd Street, you won't see the counter to order food. It's just drinks from the bar, lots of communal bench seating and lots of hipsters. No one greeted us, no one acknowledged us for a while. Some kind stranger decided to help us out and point us into the back corner that leads into another area for food. When we did discover the food, it was nothing short of glorious. For $6 to $8 you get a sausage on bun with two toppings. Fries come in small and large, you get one or two dipping sauces depending on size. That's it. Simple and straight forward.We got the Mango Jalapeno and Duck Bacon to share, fries with curry ketchup and chipotle aoili dipping sauces. Each of the sausages have their own distinct texture and flavor. The mango jalapeno wasn't too spicy but had a kick, really juicy. The duck bacon wasn't so juicy, and was on the dry side. I think the real distinction is the dipping sauce for the fries. Delicious! I put that sh*t on everything! Even my sausage dogs! The fries on it's own are pretty blah but it made for a good sauce scooper. There's a good selection of unique sodas here too, like cucumber and elderflower. The Mr. Q cucumber soda is really refreshing, worth a try!"},{"date":"2014-08-08","rating":"5.0","review":"I have to say that this place really surprised me. The food here was DELICIOUS.Being a vegetarian for majority of my life, I have to admit that I was pretty apprehensive and hesitant about trying this place when my boyfriend recommended it. I mean, it's a sausage restaurant. What could I possibly order and actually enjoy that's vegetarian friendly at a restaurant that primarily sells sausages?Upon our arrival, an employee approached us and handed us coupons for free Klein fries with one dipping sauce since they had ran out of buns. Well, that seemed strange, but we still wanted to have dinner here so we accepted the coupons and ordered our meal. I had the Vegetarian Italian with caramelized onions and spicy peppers, and fries with the Chipotle Aioli, while my boyfriend opted for the Bratwurst with caramelized onions and spicy peppers with fries and the Sweet and Sassy BBQ dipping sauce.Although bun-less, we thoroughly enjoyed our sausages. Did I mention this was the first time I had ever tried a sausage type dish? I was surprised at how much flavor it had, although the fennel was a bit overwhelming over the other ingredients. Everything tastes really great and cooked perfectly. The fries were probably the best fries Ive ever tasted. Crispy, hot, and salted just slightly enough to get a hint of the flavor. The dipping sauces were also really fun along with the assortment of mustards to choose from. I loved the indoor dining area and noted how well the space was designed and had a very sophisticated and upscale atmosphere for a fast-food type restaurant.Wurstküche is truly a gem in the Downtown Los Angeles area.

Their sausages are super delish as well.Popped in on a Friday night to pick up some grub for the Hollywood Bowl. We were on a bit of a time restraint and were bummed that there was a line out the door. They turned our frowns upside down when we grabbed the menu to peruse and saw the amazing beer selection.Woot! Woot! Blanche de Bruxelles I love u!!!They had one of my fav beers on draft and it's super rare that I find it. I've never had it in California. First time I had that beer was in Hawaii at a yard house n second time was in Denver at a bar that specialized in Belgium brews. I am a beer nerd.I was in Brussels and asked about this particular beer at the local microbrewery specializing pub and they weren't huge fans because to them it's not a microbrew and the company isn't actually in Brussels it's located in a small town outside of Brussels and as locals they were offended by the semantics. But whatever!! As an American I love this Beer and Wurstkuche had it. If Wurstkuche could get their hands on some Cantillion Gueze I'd be in Heaven. (Hint. Hint.)Ok but I digress back to the review of Wurstkuche.The line was out the door but once you cross the business threshold and make it inside you were allowed to order beer and enjoy it while you wait. There was a friendly white guy in dreads managing the line, taking everyone's orders and shouting em back to the staff. I love that they were trying to keep us happy while we waited. The beers are all served in their appropriate glass. It was fun to see people holding oddly shaped glasses with different colored brews in line. It illustrated the diverse selection.The crowd was totally hipster and super friendly. It was so much fun to stand in line and socialize. It seemed like it was a lot of people's first time there. I could overhear lots of conversations saying so n so told me to order this. Yelp told me to order the rattlesnake and rabbit and that's what I ordered. I was a little scared to eat the rattlesnake sausage as we had just found and had to kill a rattlesnake in our yard a few days ago. I think I ordered it because I had to conquer my fear of snakes and taking a bite out of it would help me take a bite out of my fear. I just hope a rattlesnake doesn't return the favor and take a bite out of me one day!!! My friend ordered the duck and that was good too. I loved that the flavors were so distinctly different. The sausages and the buns and fixings held up well until we finally got them to the Hollywood Bowl were able to settle down and enjoy them. The large order of Belgium fries on the other hand and the chipotle aioli and the blue cheese walnut sauce didn't last long. We gobbled that up on our walk back to the car and on our drive over to the Hollywood Bowl.

The wait was out the door when I was here"},{"date":"2014-07-29","rating":"4.0","review":"This whole experience eating at Wurstküche was kind of bizarre come to think of it.  First of all, the location is so low key.  It is located just outside of Downtown and Little Toyko.  Aside from a couple of other restaurants, Wurstküche is the only restaurants amongst the vacant lofts and warehouses. Once you weather through the long lines and the almost Nazi-like ordering process, you are finally inside.The inside was almost like a NYC underground bar.  It was dark, a DJ was playing some hipster jams, and people were seated in and around the perimeter of the restaurant.  The center had long bench style seats, so everyone was sitting next to everyone. It was kind of cool and unique, but uncomfortable at the same time.  You are served your food, and then you start munching.Wurstküche is known for their unique sausage meats.  The rabbit, veal & pork seasoned with white wine was definitely one of them. The taste was very mellow -- the peppers and the mustard really helped round out the flavors.What is more unique and ironic as eating rattlesnake and rabbit is that it was all in the same sausage.  Who knew these two opposing ends of the food chain would come together inside of a pork casing, and ultimately consumed by me, the top of the food chain? This irony and play on food really made this sausage interesting.  Though a little dry, it was tasty.  I couldn't help but realize I was eating rattlesnake.The hot Italian was a classic and one of my favorites.  It was familiar and brought back to something I finally knew. It was what I was used to and \"normal\".  It was juicy and had tons of flavor.  This was my back to reality sausage.All these different sausage combinations could not be enjoyed with the company of some Belgian fries and beer.  The fries were tasty, especially dipping it in some chipotle aioli. It was the perfect side to the sausages.The beer that finished everything off was Gouden Carolus. This was suggested by one of the workers and it was a great recommendation.  It was smooth in the beginning and a bit bitter at the end.  The beer really helped with the richness of all the fatty sausages.Wurstküche is an awesome spot.  The downtown hot spot is a step away from the normal restaurants in Los Angeles.  It begs to be different, and it delivers. Everything about the restaurant is unique -- and all is tasty."},{"date":"2014-12-17","rating":"5.0","review":"4.5- I really liked this place.

I was kind of hesitant because it said there were jalapenos inside the hotdog, which i am SUPER sensitive to spicy but the cashier assured me that it was not that spicy. And she was RIGHT! Usually some staff at restaurants would tell me it isnt spicy, and i end up ordering something so spicy i couldnt even finish the meal. But i had outmost respect for this GIRL after eating my hot dog. I give it 4 stars because it was pricey. My hotdog was a $8 plus tax. I have had better sausages in Texas and for way cheaper. But this will definitely suffice my sausage from texas craving. The fries are really crispy which i LOVE, and they come with yummy pesto sauce.The service here i remember the most.

After eating here, you will never eat a regular, at-home Farmer John hot dog ever again. They have tons of options that also cater to vegetarians as well. The most interesting to me was the rattlesnake-rabbit sausage. Rubbery texture but surprisingly good! I got the Mango-Jalapeno, which comes on a freshly baked roll with two toppings (not the conventional relish but sweet peppers, caramelized onions, or spicy peppers). You then grab your number and head inside, which feels like a nightclub as you go further and further in since it is a dark hallway into the dining area. The waiter brings your food over when it is ready.Dining area consists of a bar to the right and long communal tables, which reminded me of a school cafeteria. Sauces such as whole grain, honey mustard, or just ketchup were provided in squeeze bottles along the table. But what saved Wurstkuche from feeling like that was that it was very dark inside and loud music played by a DJ so it actually felt cool to be there. Get the truffle fries!

I swear I am not one of those wimpy OC denizens that is afraid to go up to The Big City. No excuses, just knew that one day, someday, I would make it to the much beloved Wurstküche.Roy B, Dave G and I hit up El Cochinito ( yelp.com/biz/el-cochinit…) before a recent Dodger game, thus were too stuffed for the traditional Dodger Dogs. Traffic was so bad coming up, and after the game going through DTLA it looked to be the same for the ride home. Dave G at the wheel, and decided it was time to grab a Wurstküche dog or two and let the traffic subside.When we pulled up a little after 11:00 the line was a few peoples worth out of the door. But by the time we parked and walked in there was maybe just 8 or so peeps in front of us. The counter service is a well oiled machine, and we were clutching our order numbers in 10 minutes. Guess the kitchen closes at midnight, cuz by the time we were leaving the place was now 2/3 full compared to almost SRO when we arrived. The dining area is definitely hipper than I imagined after reading reviews for all of these years. Yep, communal tables, but very dim lighting and a DJ spinning melody-less music. Kids? You need to listen to some real music damn it! At least our table mates were cordial and excepting of us old guys. And a shiny well scrubbed bunch they were! Guess that's called youthfulness? Since it was me and Roy's first time Dave suggested getting several various dogs and slicing them into thirds. Due to it being past my bedtime plus several brews, Dave G had to text me what exactly was ordered;The Blockwurst: made with veal and pork and topped with sauerkraut and caramelized onions. This one was the true testament for me on how awesome their products are. I don't particularly like traditional brats, and really don't like sauerkraut, but this was a very tasty treat. Fresh and juicy! The buns they use definitely kick everything up the quality ladder as well.Sun Dried Tomato and Mozzarella: made with smoked chicken and turkey. Truly don't remember this one, so not very memorable I guess, or I was close to the end of my last beer of the night. However I do remember enjoying all 5 that I tried.Hot Italian: this was my 2nd favorite as the spicy peppers atop really worked well with this pork dog.Duck and bacon with jalapeno peppers: tasty, but not as spicy as it sounded. Crocodile & pork: my favorite. Spicy and very flavorful. Loved it with the spicy mustard from one of the many large squeeze bottles on our table. I also ordered a large fry for us to split. They are so dark from double frying that Roy at first refused to eat them as he thought they were sweet potato fries. Very hot and delish, especially with their home made blue cheese dipping sauce. Be sure to ask for a couple of them, as they come in very small plastic cups.  This is supposedly a \"hipster\" hang, which oft times means indifferent service, but I am happy to report everyone from the counter people to the runners were all friendly to pleasant. Even more commendable near closing time when they must have been tired from the maddening crowds before us. For a guy that is not enthusiastic about dogs or sausages in general, I am sure to make repeat visits in the future."},{"date":"2013-06-23","rating":"5.0","review":"It pains me to give such a good rating to a hipster joint, but the food is that good.The lines get long at times to order, but it is generally worth the hassle.I ordered the duck & bacon with jalapeno peppers, and an order of fries topped with white truffle oil glaze.  I chose the chipotle aioli for my dipping sauce.  The sausage was fantastic.

He definitely had to pace himself while eating it, it was incredibly spicy. Very flavorful though!The fries were really good, very thick cuts of potatoes.

Although the sausage did taste good it was sort of dry, but I did get a hint of moisture close to when I was done so that changed my mind a bit.

Pick a sausage, pick two toppings. Thank goodness for THREE vegan sausage options. As recommended by the gal taking our order, I got the sauerkraut and grilled onions on my Vegetarian Chipotle Sausage and she definitely steered me in a good direction! su.pr/2kOSXbThere's also various mustard options on the tables. Definitely taste all of them. I pretty much loved the flavors of each one.As for the Double Dipped Belgian Fries, I highly recommend dipping them in Curry Ketchup! (Meh on the Sweet and Sassy BBQ sauce).Tons of beers to choose from but I was in \"responsible mode\" and opted for the Mr. Q Cucumber Soda. Yum!The decor is simple in design. Lots of wood, lots of straight angles, a bar, a DJ table, and long communal tables to sit. But Brian I. and I managed to find a small table in a side nook.The crowd and atmosphere is surprisingly diverse. I guess I expected the place to be dominated by 20-something hipsters. But for a tuesday evening, the crowd was a mix of families, kids with their 30-40+ year old parents, senior citizens, and the occasional college or post-college cliques.Cool place in the Art District of DTLA. I'd totally come back to try the other vegan sausages and maybe next time I'll have a beer! :)"},{"date":"2015-05-27","rating":"2.0","review":"Just hotdogs really, considering for nearly 8 USA dollars  without tipping............chicken and apple taste just like the Australian Coles 3dollars for a kg sausages"},{"date":"2013-07-25","rating":"3.0","review":"I'm not entirely sure what the hype is all about.  Well...the place definitely had a cool selection of sausages and I enjoyed my rattle snakes and rabbit hot dog.  But I made the mistake of topping it off with roasted hot and sweet peppers which had such overpowering flavors that I hated that part of my meal.  Also, I wasn't a huge fan of their hot dog buns.  They kind of tasted like Costco dog buns that I don't care for but eat it anyways when I don't feel like spending $10 on a hot dog.  I guess I was expecting a bit too much from Wurstkuche.  Fries were awesome.  Service was very friendly.  The place got too loud for my taste."},{"date":"2013-07-24","rating":"5.0","review":"I love this place.

Well, let me tell you Yelp:I go to this bar/eatery with some of my best friends because one of our buddies was raving about it. While waiting in the long line, one of the ladies who worked there offered us drinks, but excluded two of us from the group because they looked \"too drunk.\" We walked into this establishment sober as rehab counselors. Basically this lady wouldn't let two of my friends drink because of the way their faces looks. I've never seen discrimination like this before in Los Angeles.If the lady didn't exclude my friends from drinking (basically the main reason anyone goes to a bar) I would give this place a 3-4 star and more than likely come back.

The wait here at night is obviously longer compared to coming here around lunch time. I like how it's nice and bright in the dining area for lunch time, but it's so nice and hipster-y (is that a word) during night time.

One night, my boys asked me if I wanted to commute to LA to eat some hot dogs. I was thinking like whattttt you guys are crazy! LA just for hot dogs? Hahahah but hey turned out to be very delicious after all!Upon my arrival, the parking was hard to find. We couldn't find parking cause it was so busy and had to park a street down from it, let alone the line was so long! But indeed it was definitely worth the wait. As we approached the inside a worker greeted us and showed us how the menu worked and I decided to order the spicy Italian with Belgian fries. And that was so amazing! It had so much flavor and juice.  The belgian fries tasted perfect and went well with my dog. I had no idea it was that delicious and on top of that there are so many more flavors to choose from on the menu. Def be back to try them. The atmosphere felt pretty calm and chill to be and we walked towards the back to find a table, it honestly feel like a club to me since it was all dim Hahaha. Yeah , you eat your food in almost complete darkness, that's cause we went late at night , knowing that there was a bar in the back.The only downfall to my experience was that the cashier was so rude and he made me look stupid, as if he didn't know it was my first time. He kept rushing me on my order and when I asked if he could add ketchup to my dog, he gave me this stupid look and told me that there were some at the table. Like okay bruh!

The sundried tomato one tasted like pizza so that one was my favorite because I love pizza. The smoked apple sage one was good, but the slight sweetness didn't taste apple-y to me, which was disappointing. The italian one was not bad but it just tasted very average, and the santa fe jack cheese one was too spicy for me !! We got peppers on all of the hot dogs. They all tasted a little dry and overly salty in my opinion. However, the dryness could have been that no one put condiments on the hotdogs. Condiments would probably have made the hotdogs much better! The fries were very good with the chipotle and curry ketchups!! I love ketchup !!

I'm not a big fan of regular hot dogs and all that stuff, but they can be okay sometimes.I'm pretty confident that anything I try here I'll love. Their beer selection is really cool and primarily European. Their Belgian 'double dipped' Fries are godly and easily the best fries I've ever had anywhere. They're perfectly browned and crispy on the outside, but creamy on the inside...I'm slobbering all over my keyboard again. The fries come with two sauces if you get the large option and man, their selection for sauces are amazing. The Chipotle Aioli here is the best Chipotle Aioli you can find. Their Sundried Tomato Mayo is just out of this world. I tried their Pesto Mayo too, which is a pretty tasty idea, but I think it was just too intense for me. Rattlesnake Sausage was really good and if the other sausages are half as good as this was, then I can't wait to try the rest! If I had one gripe about the place, it would probably be the seating arrangements. I couldn't even understand what my friends were saying because it was too damn loud with all the people crowding in right next to you on this communal picnic bench setup.

My only quibble is that they could be a little larger (you don't get too full on one).The fries are a slightly subpar, but you get a ton of them, even with the small order. They have free ketchup and mustard in the dining room, but the tomato mayo sauce on the side is really great for 75 cents.Expect a line when you show up, but you can drink beer in it (they'll take your order and serve you). After you pay up, you head down a long hall to the beer garden type room indoors or the outdoor sidewalk eating area, where they will deliver your order (minus the beer you have in hand).This place gets a mix of everyone, which is fun. Indoors the noise is so ear-splitting even if you're surrounded by families with screaming kids, you hardly notice. The staff is very friendly, even if there are fewer smiles at first so you're not quite sure. I will definitely be back.

They have a good selection of german and belgian beers, dont worry they also have a non-alcoholic section as well. Slowly walk and bend towards the corner of the room then make a 120 degree north west turn and keep walking.

Soon you will have reach the counter, fear not, 'tis not  the end of thy journey, but rather the beginning of a new adventure. After you order at the counter and pay, you will be given a number stand to take with you. Walk through the little passage towards the back and enter the atrium of the establishment. A wide dining area reveals before your eyes. Now the challenge is to find a table big enough for you and your party members. On top of each table is a selection of condiments. My recommendation is the spicy mustard, you can't go wrong with spicy mustard on a hotdog anyday! They also have water dispenser located at either entrance or the exit of the restaurant.

Wurstküche is in the \"Arts District\" of Downtown LA, just east of Little Tokyo. It's definitely a unique vibe the minute you cross Alameda to get here. It's a weird little pocket of Los Angeles where newly built lofts/condos, hipsters, and graffiti art mix to create a very, very, very lite version of The Mission in San Francisco.  Like the weird vibe of the area, Wurstküche serves weird sausages. I mean, can I just get a normal fucking sausage? Big whoop-de-doo, so they serve exotic sausages. So what? Aside from being really gimmicky, I just didn't feel like gambling $7.50 on a rattlesnake and rabbit hot dog that I may or may not have liked. Having samples may have helped, but I decided to get a bratwurst because I am the worst fucking brat when it comes to sausages and because it was the most normal sausage I could find. My daring wife on the other hand, decided to try the duck and bacon with jalapeño hot dog. Now, when you order a hot dog, you get your choice of two toppings from a selection of four toppings: caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, and spicy peppers. For my bratwurst, I decided to top it with sauerkraut and spicy peppers at the suggestion of the guy working the cashier. Before I get to the sausage, I really did not like the sauerkraut because it just tasted flat and mushy and the spicy peppers weren't spicy. As for the bratwurst sausage, it consisted of pork, coriander, nutmeg and shitloads of salt. Seriously, I've never had such a salty sausage. I mean the entire hot dog was so salty I didn't add a single condiment to it and I ended up drinking tons of water. Surprisingly, my wife's duck and bacon hot dog topped with caramelized onions and sweet peppers tasted better than my bratwurst. What the hell? How does a hot dog place get a classic sausage wrong, yet get an exotic sausage right? As for the Belgian-style fries, which consisted of \"double dipped\" fries or in other words fries fried twice, I'm a little biased because I was never a fan. Sadly, Wurstküche doesn't offer you any other style of fries or side dishes for that matter. Also, unless you have a voracious appetite, a small order should suffice because the wife and I didn't even finish half our Belgian fries. Oh yea, and speaking of double dipping, I've never been a fan of double dipping anything whether it be a tortilla chip or a recession. On the flip side, their dining hall area and beer selection were really nice. Unfortunately, the main reason I came here was for the hot dogs and in my opinion, I was just not impressed. You know a place fails you when you start comparing it to other places and you realize that the other places were better. This is where I start chanting, \"over-rated\"! * Wurstküche lists three different vegetarian sausages under the classics section of their menu. Last time I checked there is nothing classic about vegetarian sausages for fuck's sake.

They've got amazing food and beer. The Duchess rivals as one of the most amazing beers I've ever tasted! The sausages are super flavorful and they have some very exotic meat choices on the menu. Great electronic music selection by the live DJ too!"},{"date":"2013-06-27","rating":"5.0","review":"I love you, Wurstkuche.I love your hearty meat tubes and flavorful fakemeat weenies. Seriously, really good meats encased in things here. Veggie options too!But the FRIES. I'll marry you for the fries, Wursty. Triple dipped? Whatever, they're probably fried in crack cocaine because I could freebase these babies. And if you know me (you probably do not), you know I love any flavored sauces and just condiments in general (trust me on this one), and theirs are simply great. Just terrific.They have tons of beers and even my fav after-dinner appertif, to keep you feeling saucy after the food. The hip crowd is all there, decked out in Chambray and neck beards, hogging up all the space and seating. So, be patient. I am not a patient person and have been known to flip out in the weekend lines here, but sweet child, take a lesson from me, and just suck it up.The gloriousness of the wiener will reward your noble efforts."},{"date":"2013-09-17","rating":"4.0","review":"You had me at sausages and beer. But, Wurstkuche, you took it to a whole new level, and I cannot wait to come back.It was an interesting concept and didn't know what to expect when I approached the entrance. Oh, just a little bit of a line out the door. I was able to look over the menu to get some ideas. Normally, bratwurst and kielbasa can satisfy me until one of the persons I went with (who has tried various sausages here), gave me a few suggestions. The suggestions, however, were 'exotic.' They had rabbit, alligator, and even rattlesnake. I haven't experienced any of those meats, but I was eager to give it a try. I decided on the Alligator & Pork, Smoked Andouille Sausage with caramelized onions and spicy peppers with a side of fries and their chipotle aioli sauce to pair with it. Also, got a Belgian beer to go with it. $20 bucks later and I'm headed to the seating area. It was nice. There was family style seating and smaller tables. There was plenty of natural lighting, which was beautiful, and each table came with its own condiments. There was a full bar which made ordering drinks hard to avoid. Food came out quick and I was happy with the size. The fries were great, exactly to my liking.  Lightly salted and some were crispy some weren't and I love that. My sausage? Smoky and really tasty. I can't even explain it in further detail, except I thoroughly enjoyed it. Buns? Could maybe use some work. I could understand it may take away from the sausage itself, but I thought I'd throw that in here.I would come here for food and beer. Shoot, I'd even come for the beer. I typically prefer pints at $6 or less so anything that doesn't match that, I pretty much don't come back to. But, I liked this place and the quality of the menu, both beer and food, to  come back again.Lastly, service is wonderful! The guys at the bar are super friendly! Thanks for great customer service, Anderson."},{"date":"2014-06-09","rating":"3.0","review":"Idk, no matter how hard I try I'm just never that big of a fan. I definitely like the Venice joint better and I don't even like that one that much...they just all taste the same! No matter which sausage you get, buffalo, snake, duck, rabbit, bratwurst, etc. (I've tried them all!), when you put them between that excessively bread-y bun, and underneath those excessively butter-soaked peppers & onions, they all. taste. the. same. Everyone goes for the beer and the ambience, it's a schtick, I get it.

The sauerkraut was not that great at all and I scrapped it off. The sweet peppers and onions were good.  The fries are a waste of time.  They have no real taste and despite looking like they have seasoning they don't taste like it.  Overall I would come here only if a group of people really wanted to come but I would not do so by myself."},{"date":"2013-06-18","rating":"5.0","review":"Good gracious. I adore this place. The line here can get pretty lengthy, but with good reason. I've tried pretty much all the 'exotic' sausages, as well as the more tame ones (chicken, beef, pork, other boring meats) and I haven't met a Wurstkuche sausage I didn't like! The rattlesnake is spicy and has a complex, sort of smokey flavor. The alligator, both times I've had it, can get a little dry, but just smother it in some mustard. The fries here are especially good, super crispy and you get to pick your own sauce. You can't go wrong with bleu cheese. The staff here is also really helpful in pairing beer with food. They carry a ton of German & Belgian beers which you can order at the register and if that one isn't enough, they have a bar in the eating area. The eating area can get crowded, and the mustards tend to get distributed everywhere, but if you ask any of the staff there they're more than happy to hunt your desired mustard down. I've come here as a party of two, and with a group of up to 10 people and every time has been a cinch. Service is quick & efficient, and Pie Hole is right across the street"},{"date":"2013-09-12","rating":"4.0","review":"This place is pretty good.  I had the mango jalepeno hot dog, truffle fries, and the fruli Belgian beer.  The beer was good because it was strawberry flavored.  Truly a girly beer.  The hot dogs aren't that big so most my friends got two each, making this place pretty expensive for hot dogs.  I guess people go here for the experience of tasting exotic meat and although it's good, it's nothing special to me so I don't see myself coming here again for a long while."},{"date":"2015-04-03","rating":"3.0","review":"The sausage is delicious!

The way it works is:1) Get in the consistently ridiculous line(~30min - 1.5 hrs later)2) order and pay at the front counter; obtain drinks/beer immediately3) Take your number and go to the back part of the restaurant, where there's a bar with beers on tap and many tables/long communal tables.4) wait 10-20min5) get food and eatIs the food worth the wait? Sometimes. Usually when I go, I get one of their classics ($6) (the brat is great!), and they're juicy and delicious. However, this time, I ordered the pheasant with herbs de provence (8$), and was sorely disappointed. The flavor of the sausage was ALL herbes - where was the pheasant? It was also very dry, which was very disappointing because the menu says that it's juicy! Sadness :(The fries are delicious, however; thick-cut, crunchy on the outside and pillowy on the inside, and piping hot, definitely a highlight. The truffled cheese topping is completely worth it.The bottled lemonade they have is ok; it tastes slightly under-lemony, however.Finally, their toppings: while they're good, I wish they had more variety so that I could customize my order more. Their selection of mustards is great, but the honey mustard (usually my favorite) tasted a bit off this time around.Verdict: Good for a casual stop-in if you have a lot of time to stand in line. Beer selection is great, and their classics + fries are worth it."},{"date":"2014-08-19","rating":"4.0","review":"The only qualms I have with this place is the lines, but they actually go through fast. Great variety of sausages from exotic meats to more run-of-the-mill to accommodate most tastes. I strongly recommending trying two, preferably ones from the exotic section but if that's not your thing, any of the others are great too but it's all about trying different options. Sauces are great and they have a nice variety as well. If you opt for fries, be sure to get the truffle oil. It's a must have.What goes best with sausages? Beer. Before many of the gastropubs had many craft beers on tap, Wurstkuche was there. Imports and local craft beer alike, they have a nice selection."},{"date":"2013-09-09","rating":"3.0","review":"I've been here twice now and have tried the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage and of course spaten optimator.  It's interesting because you have to order food up front but if you don't want food, you can walk straight back to the bar.  There's no waiter/waitress so you do have to go up to the bar for your beer and when you get hungry, you have to walk back to the front and order at the counter.  I thought the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage was good but didn't really find much that distinguished itself.  Perhaps my pallet is not as sophisticated but it just tasted like a gourmet sausage to me.  Still tasty though.  but pricey.  I remember it being about $20 for a hot dog and beer."},{"date":"2015-01-12","rating":"4.0","review":"Great dog, great beer, great atmosphere but long wait.

I won't even say how I think it's pronounced because it sounds Rated-R lol.

I LOVE MUSTARD and I tried every single one and they were all equally good. I didn't even need the sauces for the fries the mustard was perfect for me and I put a good amount on my sausage as well.  The sausage was AMAZING it was juicy and a little spicy (the spicy peppers and onions made the sausage over the top...i LOVED it!!!!)Overall my wurstküche experience was amazing and I can't wait to do it again!!!"},{"date":"2014-05-16","rating":"4.0","review":"Wurstkuche - \"sausage kitchen\"I at least know what wurst means in German, along with various and not necessarily connected words, in German such as sheisse, kopf, hoff, klein, nacht, Christkindl...that's pretty much it, but sheissekopf is my fave...So this place sells sauseeg.  It's purty good.  And the prices are moderate enough that you can order a couple in order to taste more than one.  I mean, everyone can always eat more sausage, no?  When I came to LA, my best friend urged, nay, insisted that we come here.  I guess this place is kind of like the Hot Doug's of Chicago, a prized encased meat purveyor with lines out the door and down the block.  And true to form, we also had to wait quite a while just to get in the door.  Thank Yeezus for a warm February night, waiting on the sidewalk wasn't a big deal since the weather was cooperating.  Once inside, we were given some menus to peruse and someone came around to get drink orders, before we even hit the counter to order.  I had a Duvel Special while I waited.  That's a nice touch.  It also makes you want to order more than you might had you not had that tasty brew in your hand.  There are glass cases so you can preview your purchases.Knowing I was going to order two, I had such a hard time choosing just two out of the 20 or so sausages on the menu.  Not wanting to waste time with the classics which consist of stuff I can get at home, and also not wanting to go too crazy with the exotic meat tubes like rattlesnake and rabbit, I went with a couple of gourmet sausages, namely the Filipino Mahalika(what the hell is Maharlika?) and the Austin Blues.  Sweet and spicy, respectively.  To balance them out I had the Maharlika topped with spicy peppers and the Austin Blues topped with caramelized onions.  You're given your number and then you walk down the side to the back where you grab some bench and put your number on the table so your meats can find their way back to you in the rambunctiously loud dining room filled with people from all walks of life, subcultures and differing degrees of inebriation.  Various mustards are in the dining room to try.  The tables that fill most of the dining area are communal style, so make sure to bring your manners!  People will ask you to pass the mustard.  Be nice about it.  Don't hog it.As I expected, my food was delicious.  I think I did the right thing by balancing out my sausages with flavors that oppose the base of the sausage, sweet with spicy and spicy with sweet versus potentiating the base flavors with sweet and sweet and spicy with spicy...I'm so anal about eating, I can't even believe this last paragraph made it onto digital paper.  Both sausages were full of flavor and well seasoned without being overly salty.  And might I add, there was a very good snap upon biting.  Noone likes a limp sausage.The buns held up under the weight of the sausage.Along with the toppings.  And I promise I'm done with the entendres.There were so many things I wanted to eat, but I'll have to save it for another trip out west.  Sausage and beer, they go so well together...Oh, I forgot to tell you!  So I had to look up maharlika.  Apparently the Maharlika were the name for the feudal warrior class of the ancient Tagalog people in the Philippines, and maharlika roughly translated, means \"freedom\"  So, Freedom sausage.U.S.A.!"},{"date":"2014-05-05","rating":"4.0","review":"Overall, love this place and love the concept. You can make reservations for a table but you still have to stand in line to order the food and the line gets LONG. At times they run out of some of the selections, which can be frustrating. Thankfully, they still had the sausages I wanted to try: Austin Blues, Filipino Maharlika, and Duck & Bacon w/ Jalapenos. I don't know if I can pick a favorite out of the three because they were all delicious. The Belgian Fries are a great complement. My husband chose the chipotle ketchup and the buttermilk ranch dipping sauces, but once we got seated all my friends were talking about the chipotle aioli! Always wanting to try what's most popular, I asked a server if she could bring me a helping of the chipotle aioli and she gladly obliged. I was willing to pay the $0.75 for the extra sauce but she came back and gave it to me for free. Another server came around frequently to make sure all of us had what we needed. For a casual, somewhat fancy fast food joint, I was really impressed with how attentive the servers were. Another reason why I love this place: Fruli Strawberry Beer! Anyone who knows me knows that I am not a big beer drinker, but I love love loved Fruli. I never drink more than a bottle of beer at a time and I ordered two Frulis, haha.

I've eaten at shared dining places like this in NY, Europe, and even maybe a couple of places in LA and never had these kinds of bad experiences.

All the times I've been in this area, I had never even heard of or seen Wurstkuche. DAFUQ?? How is this possible. I'm an idiot that's how, haha. I need to open my eyes more - especially as a Yelp Elite member. Wurstkuche (pronounced worst koosh? wurst koo-chee? wut..?)....is famous. Do they need my minion of a review? Probably not - they've been on TV, cool! And boasts thousands of reviews and a line out the door on most nights. This place blows a lot of other hot dog shops out of the water. Yes, they are different. Wurstkuche is a hip, unique, happy-staff-members kind of place. It's a hip place that lives up to the hype. They seem to put more care into their food compared to many other so-called gourmet hot dog eateries in LA.The rabbit and rattlesnake sausage is amazing. It's so juicy and flavorful. Has a little bit of a kick and topped with peppers and onions. I've had two pet rabbits before and while I felt a bit sad eating the meat, I said a small prayer of thanks to the unique animals that gave their lives to feed us humans. Haha, I'm rarely this cheesy but I love bunnies. No. I'm completely serious. So you can imagine my surprise (?) when I saw it on the menu at such a hipster restaurant. But....the sausage was excellent. And honestly, I'd order this again.The alligator sausage was delicious too. It was a bit more red, a bit more \"edgy\" in taste. In comparison to the rabbit and rattlesnake, the 'gator one seemed less soft in flavor and texture. Pairs so perfectly with cold wheaty beer or sweet bubbly soda. The belgian fries with chipotle aioli is good. Nothing out of this world but complements the hot dogs perfectly. Yeah, it's sodium overload all together as a meal but if you're eating sausage, I don't think you're really concerned about your health at  that moment.

Looking over the menu, I knew I wanted to try something... different. I decided to order their signature rattlesnake and rabbit sausage with sweet peppers and caramelized onions as well as a small order of Belgian fries and curry ketchup. My friends, on the other hand, were not quite as adventurous. One friend, who onced owned an adorable pet rabbit, could not stand the thought of eating a rabbit in a bratwurst. So she decided to get the Kielbasa with sweet peppers. My other friend went for the mango jalapeno bratwurst.I was about to sit at the counter in the front of the store when one of my friends told me that there was more room in the back. So we followed her and found an open space, with long, wooden tables and more tables on a raised surface. People wearing fedoras and plaid shirts laughed while taking bites from their brats and swigs from their biers. The sunlight filtered through the glass windows. This other side of the restaurant really was beautiful.When all of our food came, we could not wait and started to dig into our meaty and juicy bratwursts, with the peppers and onions falling off with every bite, and balanced the bottles of various mustards in our hands and, like artists, dressed up our brats.There was silence among us as we ate. The flavors were not overly powerful, but they were smoky and delicious and came together to make one really amazing bratwurst.How could I forget the Belgian fries? Crispy and with a slight curry seasoning, these fries were all too addictive. I probably could have eaten a large order by myself...Overall verdict? Wurstkuche is a place I could go to over and over and I probably would never get sick of it. There is SO much variety and the food is just so, so good... plus, Wurstkuche was founded by a USC alumnus!!

I love that they have a variety of choices from meat lovers who can appreciate and enjoy rattle snake to all veggie dogs. They also have a good selection of beer and a chill atmosphere. This particular location in downtown has a patio section with a great view of the LA skyscrapers at night. They are also conveniently locate across from the brewery. Graffiti art of know and unknown artist all around, it's great! The only difference is that this location seems a bit smaller than the Venice one and I might be wrong but didn't see a live DJ. Both have great service. I've gone to both locations with friends and this one beats it. The city vibes and the view is just great."},{"date":"2013-06-10","rating":"4.0","review":"Plenty of sausages to choose from with different combination of toppings.  But not everything is worth getting.  After coming back a few times... and now I just come back for two things.  Maharlika and their Bratwurst.  Those are my faves.Take the Marharlika and top that with Sauerkraut and Sweet Peppers with Honey Mustard and you got yourself one delicious hot dog.  As for the Bratwurst I top that with Grilled Onions and Sauerkraut with Honey Mustard.What makes this place so amazing is their selection of imported beers.  They have a good range of light to dark and sweet to bitter but not having an over bearing list.  The beer can get a little pricey, but I would gladly pay that 8-10 bucks for my La Trappe beer.  Perfect pairing for hot dogs.The only gripe that I have is seating.  its so intimidating to try and find seats especially when the seating area is full and you somewhat have a big party.  With all the communal seating area and small tables on the side, finding a seat sometimes is a tough challenge.  I am not sure if that's part of the experience, because if it is, its too much work.  haha.Great hot dogs.  Good selection of exotic meats.  Great selection of beer.  The area is a challenge to find parking in.  Finding a seat can be challenging.  But it is all worth it when you take a bite."},{"date":"2015-05-15","rating":"5.0","review":"The beers are amazing, the people are amazing and the sausages are amazing!  I would highly recommend Wurstkuche to anyone that likes having a good time :)"},{"date":"2014-10-14","rating":"5.0","review":"If you're looking for delicious food and a craft beer to wash it all down with, this is the place.

While having to park a mile away to get to my original destination I walked upon this sausage joint.The line was hella long so I was like oh well I will try it one day but not today (not a fan of lines).Make it to my original destination and guess what??? Left my ID in my other purse. So on my way back to the car I noticed the line was waaay shorter than earlier so I was like I better get in where I fit in.Now on to the food. My friend ordered the Rattlesnake & Rabbit. I guess its delicious because he devoured it as if he was a damn snake himself. I personally can't eat the cute animals (sorry Thumper).I had the Duck & Bacon with jalapeno peppers. DaBomb.net. It was so flavorful! We shared fries with the Blue Cheese Walnut & Bacon dipping sauce . I heart blu cheese.

Wurstkuche is cutesy little gastropub located in DTLA. Upon first walking in, you are bombarded with the long line that can take a while, but it is definitely worth the wait. Feel free to look over the menu, watch foodies snapping pictures and sip on some cucumber water while you are waiting. I've been here about 3 times and have been impressed each time. Once you are done ordering you are free to walk down the long hallway into what feels like a fancy mess hall. A wall full of 2 seater tables and 2 long benches for all to share.If you have personal space issues don't come here. This is the place to mingle with fellow LA peeps and foodies. & get ready to get messy! Im not a veggie but I Love their tomato, mozzarella & basil sausage! I tried the farro veggie sausage... Definitely didn't fancy it at all. Their duck & bacon one is Delish too! Oh & their fries are mouth watering and become even better when you get the bleu cheese & bacon .... And....

Oh well!Ok, so I really don't know why Wurstkuche is so popular. Its menu is definitely a novelty, but maybe it's just me.. they taste like regular sausages. I had the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage as it was the most exotic one available, but it wasn't anything special. The fries were good but also nothing special.Their selection of beer is pretty good. Unfortunately for me, I never really remember what I like and what I've tried, so I decided to go for something I've never tried: strawberry flavored beer. It was pretty much like soda.. or hard cider.. you get what I mean. I don't think they mention how big the beers are cuz my strawberry juice/beer was really small compared to my friend's Blue Moon :[ We went on a Sunday for lunch, and it was pretty poppin. We managed to find a seat in this little table wedged into the corner. I think it could be a cool bar (maybe it's like that at night..)I liked the location though.. It was kinda east of Little Tokyo. Lots of street art/ graffiti and a handful of geocaches around. However, since I live in the valley, coming out to east LA is pretty far (I know there's another location in Venice), but even if it were closer to me, I don't know if I'd necessarily come back."},{"date":"2014-09-03","rating":"5.0","review":"In the two times I have been here during my trips to LA, both occasions were during Fourth of July.

Very flavorful.2.  Sun Dried Tomato & Mozarella - Smoked Chicken and Turkey with Carmelized Onions and Sweet Peppers.  Delicious! Not too heavy and still juicy and well balanced. 3.  Austin Blues -Hot and Spicy, tri-pepper & hardwood smoked pork with Sauerkraut and Carmelized Onions.  Wasn't my favorite, was a bit bland in comparison to the Kielbasa and Sun Dried Tomato & Mozarella--but still pretty good.   For our belgian fries we had the choice of two dipping sauces.  We ended up getting the Bleu Cheese Walnut & Bacon and the Curry Ketchup.  I was dissappointed in the Bleu Cheese Walnut sauce...it didn't have much taste or flavor to it.  The Curry Ketchup on the other hand had a blast of flavor.  It was good, but I'm definitely curious as to what the other sauces taste like.  I think it'd be cool if Wurstkuche just had all the sauces available to everyone, I think that would be an aspect that they should incorporate, especially if they wanted their patrons to fully enjoy their meal.  Just like how Chick-fil-a has all those sauces available for their chicken, all sauces should be readily available for their sausages!  I think the limitation slightly bothers me.  Despite that, Wurstkuche is delicious!  I'll definitely be back again!"},{"date":"2015-05-01","rating":"5.0","review":"Excellent Service and atmosphere!

French fries are true Belgium style and dipping sauces are what make the experience mind-blowing. Curry ketchup, pesto mayo, chipotle... The list of delicious dips goes on and you'll have trouble limiting yourself to a selection of only 1-2!Pricing here is above average, even for the beer. It's worth it for the quality but keeps me limited in what I decide to order. I suppose that could be a good thing considering I'd get carried away here.I could go on and on about the food. But there are reasons I've knocked off a star, which is related to the following frustrations:  long lines that don't move quickly, a tiny venue, and highly limited parking options. While I usually walk to this establishment, I ended up driving today and spent 20 minutes looking for parking. After finding something a 10 minute walk away, we then stood in line for another 30 minutes. (Can I mention the scorching sun happened to be out?) WIth the tiny venue itself, I got elbowed and stepped on more times than I'd like to admit. We got lucky with a table, though usually the large wooden tables provide plenty of seating if you're willing to scoot up close to a stranger. The actual wait for our food was completely reasonable and seemed speedy due to our long journey to get through the door. I still devoured the food within minutes, because the truth of the matter is that Wurstkuche is not hyped up. The quality is real, the food is phenomenal, and after cursing the long wait to sit down at a table you'll want to do it all over again once you're finished.

The Chipotle Aioli and Pesto Mayo are my favorites every time. The servers at the counter are always SUPER nice and when I went most recently, they recommended a beer for me that was absolutely DELICIOUS.

However, my friend insisted that I would love their Frulli beer, which is a beer that taste exactly like strawberries. I am so glad I listened to him instead of getting hard cider. The Frulli was delicious! I landed up getting 3 of them, which wasn't too bad since it came in 4oz cups and only had about 4.5% alcohol. My friend and I agreed that this was the only spot to get a beer like that.

When you first walk in, the place looks impossibly small. But then you walk down a super dark, and long hallway to the back and you find a whole new restaurant. I don't understand the layout at all or if there's even a theme that they are going for. A huge dark room, cafeteria style seating, a big bar...basically a warehouse that has been somewhat decorated. Interesting. Anyways, my boyfriend and I decided to order 4 hotdogs because we wanted to try a bit of everything. The guy working that night looked like he hated his life and was totally rude but the food made up for it. We ordered the Kielbasa, Louisiana Hot Link, Mango Jalapeño, and the Filipino Maharlika. We also had to get some of their Klein Fries with Truffle Oil because who doesn't like hot truffle fries! For the toppings, we settled on Caramelized Onions, Sweet Peppers and Sauerkraut. Out of the 4 hot dogs, my favorite was the Filipino Maharlika. It tasted just like the Asian breakfast sausages my boyfriend likes. Maybe that's why I like it. I also really liked the Louisiana Hot Link. Even though it tasted just like a normal hot link, it was done nicely and super delicious with the onions. The Mango Jalapeño had good flavor but I wanted a little more spice. The same with the Kielbasa. Both could have used a bit more flavor and spices. The Klein fries were delicious. Yum. It doesn't even need ketchup because it was covered in truffle oil. I dont like the picnic table thing they are doing. And I really don't get why the place is so dark. It's hard to see anything but they make some good dogs. Worth a visit for sure. 4/5"},{"date":"2015-04-11","rating":"3.0","review":"Meh. It's a hot dog.

Great beers and sausages, you'll feel like you're in a German Beer Hall, uh, hence the German-inspired name and décor or the place. Get adventurous and order a rabbit or snake sausage, the percentage of exotic meet is actually pretty low because the base is made of Italian sausage (a little off from the German theme, but sausage is sausage). Fries are awesome as well, this not the kind of place to get a real meal, it's a place to socialize with everyone around you and the food pairings are meant to be shared and/or eaten quickly.

They cook them all on the same grill, I think. You may think it's not meant for vegetarians but veggie sausages are fun and can be creative and it helps business. Frankly, the menu is small and boring after two visits. The fries are better at Links N Hops. At night you compete with drunkards from the local bars.

But wait...just look for the long \"CLUB ENTRANCE\" line and you're there. Friday night...1000pm, an hour or so before they closed, the line out the door and down the side of the building. You can't imagine wieners and brats to be this good? If you're in a group, have one or two jump out while you go find parking. Good luck finding anything close to the restaurant. and have a buddy system walking to and from your car (you might get jacked). Can I say that it was worth the wait? Yeah I can. It was pretty fun. The brats and sausages are pretty affordable until you order a beer or two with your meal. My Bockwurst, small fries and pop was about $15 with tip. You're going over $20 if you order alcohol. Bockwurst...pretty good. They really added the grilled onion and kraut on top for me. The fries were JUST OK...and I think were a bit too burnt. The soda pop..Nesbitt's Strawberry was ok (I enjoyed a Faygo much more). Bench style seating for a big group of 8..not too good. Luckily we found a table and with the quick turnaround, the table next door got up not too long after we sat down and before all the food arrived. House, dance music and DJ...not too bad. Enjoyed it.

I am also gving them four stars because of the parking.  There is only street parking, but the area appears to be safe.   Usually when I go I need to walk a block or two, so it is not WeHo bad, but kinda a nuisance.Menu:  They offer exotic meats such as alligator or snake to the more common fare such as sausage.  I tend to go spicy and order the Spicy Italian Sausage.  The fries are also amazing- but the sauces are what really makes the food delicious.Drinks: A complete menu or ciders and beers for any taste you have in mind.   The ciders are great, but I tend to go for the lighter beersTry this place out.   It is very low key and extremely hipster, but the staff makes you feel extremely welcome and are more than happy to explain the different meats and tastes.  It is really cool since it is not touristy, you really need to know this place is here to find it- so its popular with LA locals.   Its not like Pinks on Western Ave where the location is more popular than the food they serve, crowded with tourists who can't decide what they want."},{"date":"2013-05-30","rating":"5.0","review":"Not sure how I missed reviewing you Wurstkuche!

I make this place an exception. I've been here a couple of times and have found that despite my lack of love for sausages, I cannot help but love the food here. I'm not much of an exotic eater so I've tried the more normal tasting sausages such as the mango and jalapeno ( which is really good a bit spicy and sweet) the chicken and apple sausage which is so good and you get two, and the sun dried tomato and mozzarella which is just quite yummy and cheesy. I don't really like salty sausages so all the ones I've mentioned are more of the sweet tasting one. You also get a choice of sweet peppers, spicy peppers, onions, and saurekrat. The fries are so so good they are crispy and with the variety of sauce you can't go wrong. I usually go for the chipotle ketchup for a little kick. The atmosphere is pretty chill you go order and then take a number and go sit down. Most of the time there is a line but it's not too bad. It's also pretty nice to sit outside during cool nights. Inside the seating has a bunch of long bench tables so it's good for large groups. If you have a huge appetite I recommend you getting two orders of sausages just because the portions are not that large. This is definitely a place if you want to try a variety of different sausages and yummy german fries :D"},{"date":"2015-10-19","rating":"5.0","review":"Been here quite a few times.

Sadly, alligator and pork is no longer an option, but it won't take away from me being a patron. Buffalo, beef, and pork is also a good choice. Duck & bacon is great too! Beers are awesome. From Aventius to St. BERNARDUS. Special thanks to Paulina and Mark, for making us feel at home, every time we go.

First off, it is in the Arts District, so it's fun to check out all the street art and people watch while you are here, and in general it has a good vibe compared to other parts of DTLA. Secondly, the design of the restaurant is very unique. You order at the front. I sort of was confused about where the entrance was when I first got here, but it isn't where the patio area that you see people sitting at is. It's on the other side, so you just turn the corner and enter through the other door. The menu has several options, and allows you to customize your sausage to your liking. I asked the cashier there for suggestions, and ended up having the mango jalapeno with sweet peppers, and fries to share.They give you a number, and you head down the hallway to the back, and there is optional patio seating. The seating area is very unique, too. I like the ambiance since the whole seating area is very open, so you see the whole bar and get a view of the whole place. I don't remember there being AC, so it was a bit warm, and you don't need to bring your sweater as in other restaurants. I remember the beer being served in interesting glasses, and it made me want to order one!The food was fantastic, and came out in a timely manner. They have a wide array of dressings on the side of each table--different kinds of mustard, ketchup, etc. The fries were pretty bomb, and I got the chipotle sauce.

This was my third time coming, but I was still pretty excited. I guess that says something about their food. :POne of the must-try places in LA because they serve exotic (and I guess original, if you're into that type of thing) hot dogs. So far, I've tried the rattlesnake sausage and duck sausage as well as their fries with the chipotle and pesto sauce. The rattlesnake sausage was good, but maybe a little too obscure for my taste. I preferred the duck sausage which was delicious with their sauerkraut. The chipotle sauce for the fries was kind of meh, but the pesto sauce was delicious! All of it was a pretty decent price; being from Chicago, I could definitely see it being a lot more expensive if it were in downtown Chicago for instance.The ambiance is pretty cool as well. You order in the front, which is kind of a small area (not meant for you to lounge around), but once you proceed down the (pretty dark) hallway, you'll be greeted with lots of noise and a big, lodge-looking dining area. During the day time, it's pretty bright and well-lit, but at night, you can barely see the person sitting next to you. For me, that was the only notable negative about this place. You can help yourself to water, there are really cool beer taps, and all of the tables are well-stocked with pretty much every sauce imaginable--34892340 different mustards and ketchup, of course. They'll bring your food to the table and I commend them for being able to spot your number in the darkness.

The bartenders are very knowledgeable about beer, if you tell them what kind of beer you typically like they can make recommendations. Huge selection of beer, too. The prices seem high at first glance, but most of the beers come out in massive beer steins, so it kind of makes it worth it. Parking at this location can be a little tricky, especially during weekend nights."},{"date":"2012-06-30","rating":"4.0","review":"I finally went here and joined in on this whole sausage craze. I for sure went for one of the exotic sausages and it was great! I got the crocodile/ pork/ andouille sausage and it was amazing. I was slightly disappointed that it tasted more like pork and andouille rather than crocodile. (I've had gator before and its delicious). I also had a bit of my friend's rattlesnake sausage and thought it had great flavor. The fries were bomb! I definitely had a hard time deciding which sauces to get... they all looked amazing. I decided on the chipotle aioli and the tzatziki. Both of which were excellent.  : )"},{"date":"2014-09-27","rating":"4.0","review":"I was roaming the art district when i ran into this spot.

The sausage was on point, and the vegetables and the onions on top were tasty! I'll pass on the fries next time. They were mouth burning hot when they came out and I like it when my fries are crispier.The Spartan Optimator was good too. Tried a sip of the Fruli as well and it tasted like juice...super girly.

I got the vegtarian chipotle dog I believe with sweet peppers and onions. It was good, however, the dog was a bit dry. Maybe this is because it's vegetarian, but I wasn't such a fan of this dog. Didn't finish it. But it was a good experience. The fries on the other hand were amazing. I had tried them before and I loved them. The taste remains the same even after you eat em after 2-3 hours (brought leftovers since I couldn't finish em). The size small is perfect for 1 person! After, my boss treated us to some beers. I had the Fuli I believe, it was a strawberry flavored brew and it was delicious. I don't like beer, personally, but this one was an exception. I felt like I was sippin on champagne!

The line was out the door when we arrived but there's a host who goes around handing out menus and taking drink orders while you wait. What's unique about this place is their selection of exotic sausages as well as their known Double Dipped Fries [which is the whole reason why he chose this place because he knows about my OBSESSION with fries] as well as their large selection of tapped & bottled beers [drool...]For the evening, I chose the Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle [chipotle, arbol chilles, garlic, & onions] & he selected the Crocodile & Pork, Andouille [hickory smoked, thick casing], both with Caramelized Onions & Spicy Pepper toppings, as well as the Groot [Large] order of the Double dipped fries with Curry Ketchup & Pesto Mayo for our dipping sauces. For beers, we selected De Koninck Amber [Belgian pale ale] and I forgot what he had..The dining area was modified after Octoberfest and I LOVED it!! It's very cafeteria like where you choose your own seating with dim lighting and a DJ was spinning that night. I would describe it as hypster but sexy at the same time. The whole place is super casual which I truly appreciated. We ended up sitting at the bar and the bartenders are beyond friendly & knowledgeable. We ordered a second round of drinks which included: St. Feuillien [saison/ farmhouse ale] & Kwak [amber ale]. Majority of the beers have their own glass which makes the whole experience a little more fun. The bartenders definitely know their stuff, they suggested our second round based off the ones we were drinking and we thoroughly enjoyed each & every single one of our beers,Our sausages were DELICIOUS, super juicy and flavorful with its own unique taste! It is definitely on the pricier side but it was something to try and experience. I would have to say, if you decide to order ONLY one sausage, you might not be 100% satisfied so beware!!We ended our meal with their dessert: Toasted Apple Pie Ice Cream Sandwich [on oatmeal raisin cookies]...YUM!!!

It's a must try. I first came here a few years ago, before I was yelping and then again during the year of the Burger 2011. I recall they were doing amazing things, things that translated into the burger world and probably made it in part, what it is today. Buffalo, Duck, Croc, Rabbit exotics and not nearly at the $15 price range of a burger patty. I found the buffalo and croc dry, Duck was too fatty, and the rabbit was bland, perhaps to light for my tastes. I personally love the gourmet because of the Austin Blues, Maharlika, Santa Fe Jack. Maharlika reminds me of my roots, but not quite as authentic. Santa Fe spicing and jalapeno works perfect with the turkey and to me wouldn't work so well with beef, pork or chicken.. Austin blues is hot, spicy, but plenty of smoke flavor.The hot Italian is densely flavored and you can really tell the quality of their pork in this one. Bockwurst is excellent intro to exotics with the veal.Love the sauces, all housemade, love the toppings, all housemade, but the fries are what people rave about. I knew the Belgian waffle was better than regular, but who knew their fries put a hurt on regular Frenches so well. Chipotle aioli is smooth, but flavorful and is my favorite. All are good, but for their own reasons. I do not reccoment the white truffle oil glaze. Knowing the price of truffles and realizing it's synthesized and not the same makes it not worth trying a pretty much perfected frie. Lines out the door most of the time because it's freaking good and inexpensive. Don't look for steady BBQ smoke trail, sausage smoking is a little different."},{"date":"2014-04-08","rating":"4.0","review":"A good gourmet hotdog place.

With the closing of Al's Bar, and the more recent closing of Bloom's General Store, the corner has had little more than a sushi placel and a proliferation of guerilla art keeping it alive.Wurstkuche, which opened in Nov 2008 in the former location of the Wolfskill Theater (and before that, Alberto's underground \"Clubhouse\"), brought the crowds back to Third and Traction with free-flowing Belgian beer and simple food done right.Restaurants that try to diversify too much are always a bad sign. Cousins Tyler Wilson and Joseph Pitruzzelli knew the secret of a successful restaurant is to serve one or two items that are pure perfection. What goes better with beer than sausages and french fries? As American as that may sound, this place has a decidedly brewhaus bent, with over 20 German and Belgian beers on tap, along with one concession - a Pabst Blue Ribbon - maybe just for the irony.The food is simple, but not without flair. The thick pomme frites are served with a variety of dipping sauces, like Curry Ketchup, Thai Peanut and Pesto Mayonnaise. You can also order them with a white truffle oil glaze. Swank.Along with some truly exotic sausages (Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers, Alligator and Pork smoked Andouille) there are four vegetarian sausages, including Mexican Chipotle and Apple Sage. Other than the vegetarian options, all of the sausages are made with natural casings, all of them pork casings except for the Apricot and Ginger, made with chicken and turkey in a lamb casing. There are four toppings available for your meat: Caramelized Onion, Sweet Peppers, Spicy Peppers, and Sauerkraut, not to mention a wide variety of mustards.The sausages come from at least four different purveyers, so although they are all high quality, there will not always be a consistency from sausage to sausage. The Kielbasa had a tight snap and was nice and juicy with lots of flavor. The andouille had a similar snap, but a much heartier, slightly tougher texture. The heat was not so intense as to make the sausage inedible, which is a common mistake with Louisiana sausages. The apple and sage flavors in the vegetarian sausage were not very pronounced, even after scraping all of the toppings off. Without a casing, there was no snap at all. The texture was that Gardenburger-esque veggie softness that may not be to everyone's taste. But vegetarians should love it.The ambiance is open and comfortable, with wall-to-wall crowds at lunch rush and weekend nights. During a weekday afternoon, the mood is slow and easy. The restaurant stays open until midnight, but sometimes the bar will stay open a little later if there is a good crowd."},{"date":"2013-02-10","rating":"4.0","review":"Fortune favors the flexible. Or maybe I just like to see things that way. I'm in LA roughly every 2 months for a getaway. This started maybe about 2 years ago when a friend and I were discussing inexpensive relaxing trips we could do and LA was it. Being that we go so much we have this routine down. Get hainan chicken, get frothy milk with honey boba, and then go to Disneyland for a day, and eat in Japan town at this Ramen place we like. Upon arriving at the ramen place... there is a huge line as usual. Something to know about me, I loathe waiting in lines unless I am absolutely craving a particular food from a particular restaurant. Ultimately I'm extremely impatient. Nevertheless we put our name down and I'm looking at their adverts in the window. Yelp to the rescue! There in the window was a listing of the top 10 restaurants in the area from Yelp, and there was Wurstkuche listed as a gastropub. We ditched the line and decided to take a nice stroll over.We arrive and find a beautiful brick building (sidebar: I LOVE LOVE LOVE spaces with exposed beams and brick walls). So in my book this place is already a winner, then I look at the drink list and Fruli, a strawberry beer is on tap. Done and done. We also get the sun dried tomato & mozzarella (Smoked chicken & turkey) sausage to share as well as white truffle oil glaze fries with curry ketchup sauce and bleu cheese walnut & bacon sauce. The bacon sauce was so good we annihilated it and had to go back for seconds of the sauce. I normally hate bleu cheese, as I generally like milder cheeses but this was amazing. The outdoor patio was cute, but narrow and very busy, so we opted to sit inside. They had long table benches in the middle like any normal gastropub and smaller tables near the wall. The DJ was playing beats on her MacBook Pro.

Lots of choices here, but you really can't go wrong. Unlike the real world, you don't have to be picky with which sausage to choose.\"Goodkuche\" is a more appropriate name. This place is incredibly hard to dislike because it's so cool. Housed in an unsuspecting warehouse-type venue in the down and out part of downtown, Wurstkuche's interior is a refreshing sight. High ceilings, wooden planks paired with dark-colored slab cover the walls, a live DJ, private and community-style seating, etc. - this place easily doubles as a lounge at night.But alas, the accompanying food must be good too. The choices are many and the sausages are juicy, but as a whole, the hot dogs were okay. Good enough to satisfy a craving, but not enough to repeatedly induce the craving. You pick two of four possible toppings: sweet peppers, spicy peppers, caramelized onions, and sauerkraut. Along with unlimited curry ketchup and whole-grain mustard, you got yourself a pretty tasty 'wurst. But if you're looking for a hot dog with custom-paired toppings that makes a meal go from \"this is really good,\" to \"I will never eat a hot dog anywhere else,\" this isn't that place.

There's another side door, which leads you to the actual ordering counter where you can order the most interesting meats in a sausage. I have yet to try all the menu items, let alone the exotic meats, but they have all been delicious. Burst of oils and juices are expected with each bite. The fries are really soft and crispy on the outside and are paired nicely with two sauces of your choice. This place offers a wide selection of beers, and I really admire the effort in using the properly shaped glasses that are used to accentuate each.  Lunch time seems to be the better time to come here since it's much quieter and easier to find a place to sit.

So far I've tried Mango Jalapeno, Lousiana Hot link, and Kielbasa. They were all excellent! The mango one is slightly sweeter which i loved :) They were all cooked to perfection and they taste amazing. AHH SO GOOD! I definitely want to try more.

We're huge street art fans and we clicked away taking pictures left and right as Wurstkuche is in the Arts District. Can't get any better than this for is.Wurstkuche is slightly hidden, even the entrance is a tad misleading. It's almost like you walk into the rear of it (maybe we did?).  No one greeted us. Granted I'm not expecting a red carpet treatment, I just wanted a smile and a hello. Instead we got confused looks (maybe because my 9 year old son was with us...bringing a 9 year old into a beerfest restaurant?).  We ordered our dessert, paid the $5 plus for it, and entered the eating area. It's Hipster Central. Everyone was eating sausage of some kind.  I didn't mind it, but I knew I wasn't going to eat there.Ice cream sandwich was yummy. Seating area was cool.  If you want to impress a date or a friend with this out of the way hipster joint, you just might.

I heard about Wurstkuche through some friends on Facebook and Instagram and was curious after seeing that many sausage concoctions. We arrived around 8PM and found a rather long line extending to the outside of the restaurant. The wait took over half an hour, which was to be expected, judging by the popularity of this place. I decided to go with the Rattlesnake& Rabbit w/Jalapeno Peppers hot dog, topped with sweet peppers and caramelized onions, since the menu described this  sausage as mildly spicy with a buttery taste. I also split a large order of Belgian Fries with truffle oil with the rest of my group. Now I've heard that reptile meat is actually quite mild and a bit reminiscent of chicken, so I wasn't expecting any weird or off-putting tastes. Actually, it just didn't really taste like anything at all. At least not much different from that of any other dirty dog I could get off the streets of LA. The sausage had a bit of a kick to it but the peppers and onions did most of the work on my palate. The Belgian Fries were nothing special either, as we paid an extra $2 for truffle oil, but were asking ourselves, \"Um, where's the truffle?\" Just like any other thicker cut fries, some of the pieces were soft and mushy while others were crunchy. This was a side dish that we could've done without. Located in a quiet yet hipster neighborhood, this place is more about the hype of trying exotic meats. I mean, besides watching Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmerman, where else are you going to get much exposure to eating stuff like crocodile, rattlesnake or buffalo? Come here to try it for the sake of trying it, but don't expect any wild, culinary awakening."},{"date":"2015-03-16","rating":"4.0","review":"If you want a really incredible brat this is the place.

Since it was my first time I wanted to try a \"regular\" cut of meat first before I tried anything exotic. So I tried the bratwurst with sauerkraut and caramelized onions, with the large fries! Accompanied with chipotle aioli, and sun dried tomato basil mayo I wanna say. I didn't care for the sun dried tomato mayo so much, but the chipotle one was pretty tasty. I really liked the huge ass condiment bottles on each table. The honey mustard was really good, I straight up dipped my fries in it. The whole grain mustard was really prominent but the flavor was really good too. But hands down dat honey mustard would taste good on anything. My friend got the kielbasa with sauerkraut and caramelized onions, as well. I felt like a total goober not knowing about the huge patio seating. I had to wait for the a customer to tell me there's more seating in the back. I'm an idiot. But anyway, we finally get our food and everything paired really well together. I wanna go back and try the fancy sausages and not just stick with something so plain. But, the service was very friendly and I like that there is water on hand, and actually in glasses. I kinda just want more of their fries right now with honey mustard, chomp chomp munch munch."},{"date":"2013-05-28","rating":"2.0","review":"I had high hopes for this place.

There's also more flavors for those who don't want to explore outside of the \"norm.\" I have to say though, approximately 7 bucks was kind of pricey.. Thats for the weiner alone. Fries you have to order separately. Even so the portion sizes are lacking for the price. But I guess they live off the variety of sauces they have. Thumbs up for the strawberry beer though!The seating here is cafeteria style. So count on getting a lot of \"you can't sit with us\" looks..

The only thing they serve is sausages, fries, and beer. There are options for everyone. They serve the typical hot Italian sausage  as well as some more interesting ones like rabbit and rattlesnake. For those vegetarians out there don't fear they have vegetarian sausages as well! ATMOSPHERE: The atmosphere of the place is nice it isn't really a restaurant but kind of like a food court setting. You take a number and they will bring your food to you so tip is not strictly necessary. Their décor is cute filled with picnic tables covered in brown paper. They also will provide you with crayons to sketch while you are waiting. Throwback to some good childhood fun  .  At the tables there is an assortment of around 6 different types of mustards, which are available for you to use. MUST TRY: I've been here twice and so far it has been a pleasant experience. The staff is super friendly and right as you walk in explains that you that they only serve sausages. They will also direct you towards a large beer selection which is a must try! For those of you who don't like beer do not fear! They have Belgium strawberry beer, raspberry beer, and grapefruit beer. They taste almost like sparkling juice with a buzz and are delicious. Highly recommend getting a beer with your food.The fries are also a MUST try. This place probably has one of the best fries I've ever eaten and I can say that I would go back to this place just for the fries. (I think it's even better than the sausages). SAUSAGES: The sausages were tasty but nothing special. I've tried the one with chicken and apple, mango halepeno (with turkey and chicken). I've tried the rattlesnake and rabbit. I'm personally not a big fan of sausages unless they are in pasta so others might feel differently about this. The next time I go back I might just get a hot Italian sausage which is one of the more normal ones. OVERALL: Because the sausages weren't my favorite I'm going to give this place four stars. I will definitely be coming back for the fries and the beer! Again don't let me discourage you from getting the sausages! I know some people who really like them and some people who don't."},{"date":"2014-12-23","rating":"4.0","review":"I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed.

If you're feeling adventurous for something exotic (alligator? Rattlesnake? Rabbit?

But try to accept those things as part of the experience rather than cons and you'll have a great time. Besides, this is a place you've come to for the taste of something different. The noise and crowd are part of it. If you're not in the mood for either of these, try this place when you are. Parking is a bit tough.

Although the display is somewhat smaller than what you would expect, their selection is quite the opposite. They have your standard Bratwurst, Chicken Apple and Kielbasa (to name a few) for the safe zone diners. If you feel a little adventurous, they also have rabbit with fennel as well as rabbit with peppers.....a delicious serenade of flavors and bite when it makes its way into your mouth. Their bread is fresh and adding condiments such as their spicy mustard is a must! As for the space, I was only kidding, if you walk into the long hallway along the restrooms, you will see they have a huge hall with plenty of tables and benches with a bar to enjoy your seasoned meat among your fellow carnivores.

The veggie sausage is great on its own but I slather on some of that barbecue sauce, ketchup, and honey mustard cuz I like it like that. Their pomme frites/Belgian fries are to die for--the best, best, best!!! We usually get curry ketchup for dipping and/or use regular ketchup from the squeeze bottles at the table or nothing at all. The kids get other sauces. Belgian beer, we usually order La Chouffe or Gouden Carolus because they compliment the flavors of the sausages quite well, are strong and delicious, and are always on tap.

The Belgium fries are a must and their sauces are mighty tasty. I wash it down with any of their cold beers.Their ambience is very dark and loud. I like it though, it fits in with that DTLA vibe. Sometimes it's hard to find a table at night so I take my date night food to go and eat it somewhere else.Service is always friendly, but I don't like the Venice location. On two occasions they overcooked and burned my sausage. But overall this is my to go hot dog place in DTLA."},{"date":"2014-07-28","rating":"3.0","review":"Gourmet Hot Dogs, Yesssir!! Awesome atmosphere and great vibe place, wide selection of hot dogs & sausages. This place ALWAYS has a line in front of it, and when a vegetarian person says they have some amazing food, its a must try. The quality of food was very good and the sauces were complimentary and savory. Maybe it was what i got, but the sausage wasn't big enough for the bun. I tasted a lot of bread and that's kind of what I came out with. Dont get me wrong, the taste of the actual hot dog was great, and the Fries were very very good!! I definitely want to try this place again."},{"date":"2013-05-12","rating":"3.0","review":"I've been reading about this place, it was featured in Bon apetite magazine, and OC's food magazine and yelp of course. I'm quite intrique by the hype and high reviews.I'm not a huge fan of sausages... but i like them occasionally. Bratwurst... kielbasa, hot links type. So i figured, why not!!  I ordered the Rattlesnake & rabbit  jalapeno peppers and the Buffalo, beef, pork sauasage  both with the same toppings caramelized onion and sweet peppers.well the rattlesnake & rabbit was juicy.. the buffalo was rather dry or not as moist plumpy juice sausage as i had thought in my head.i also tried my friend's duck sausage & louisiana hot links. I think the hot links is the #1 most juiciest one. The rattlesnake is 2nd, buffalo and duck  i'm not quite impressed.The buffalo as i said was a little on the dry side. The duck i didn't like the fennel or cumin taste... this place had a long line.... i think most people come here to get drunk.... Lots of beer options.... and there is DJ's.  I forgot they have outside patio... i would have liked that.. since you can actually have a conversations.. and be able to hear. Vs the inside seatings.. where you have communal benches or limited tables that are oddly shaped.if you're a beer fan and a sausage fan definitely try this place out.  I heard the fried are really good.. but I'm not a big potato fan. So i didn't ordered any.i do know that 2 sausages was a lot for me.. i hardly eat the bread. If you liek to try varieties... definitely bring friends and cut them in half and you can share & get to try a bunch at the same time."},{"date":"2014-02-19","rating":"4.0","review":"I have tried many different sausages here, and I will admit it has been a while since I have last been here, so I can't remember which ones were good. I mostly enjoyed the fact that they had a wide array of exotic meats to choose from, such as rabbit and rattlesnake and alligator sausage. I am an avid wild game aficionado. They have THE BEST selection of Belgium beers as well, I strongly recommend either the lychee-flavored Gouden Carolus, or the Duchesse de Bourgogne if you're a fan of sweeter, dessert beers. I almost never drink alcohol, but whenever I am at Wurstkuche I absolutely have to imbibe their wonderful array of beers here. It is pretty expensive considering it's just beer and sausage, especially since I can eat WAY more than 3 hot dogs in a sitting LOLOL, but it's definitely worth trying at least once. Oh, I do have to warn people who are outside of LA, you have to crawl through the shithole that is known as the downtown art district to get to Wurskuche, and parking is valet or paid meters only. If I am ever trapped in the shithole that is known as DTLA ever again I will definitely come back."},{"date":"2015-02-27","rating":"4.0","review":"Luv the relaxed ambiance.  Tried a few sausages & I must say,  rattlesnake & rabbit is my fav!!

The brat is solid, but whenever I come here I feel obliged to order something off of the exotic menu. I've had a couple and they're all pretty good. I tend to go to the rattlesnake & rabbit.  Love the peppers as an add-on, either spicy or sweet & sometimes both.  I recently tried the pheasant, which was not surprisingly good. i still like the rattlesnake & rabbit better. Pretty easy to find a seat inside the beer hall, but harder to find a seat outside. Can get crowded at lunch time, but the line generally moves quickly."},{"date":"2014-08-12","rating":"4.0","review":"I came here simply because I wanted to experience the hype of eating authentic German food.  Unfortunately, I had the urge to just eat at home...which was a bad idea because the food got a bit dry/cold after walking back. Tip: plan to eat here!Today's dinner consist of Duck and Bacon wurst, Bockwurst, and Belgian Fries with Bacon Walnut Blue Cheese dip.  A lot of people made a big deal about the Duck and Bacon wurst...but it was not pleasurable.  First of all...the meat was dry. Despite the fact I took it to go, the taste was like someone squeezed the juices out of the poor animals...then them sit in a sauna.  Not a good start.  The Bockwurst, on the other hand, was very flavorful.  Each bit had a juicy sensation and a slightly spicy aftertaste.  I preferred that over the Duck/bacon.  The star, however, had to be the fries.  Who would've thought that double-fried fries would taste so good.  The exterior was slightly crunchy...but the interior was soft and fluffy.  Adding Blue cheese with bacon and walnuts is genius!! At first you taste the tartness of the blue cheese...but then you get the fatty opposition with the bacon and walnuts balancing it out.   I love how this is close to my place in Little Tokyo!! Within walking distance!  I'm definitely comin' back to this place in the near future!!"},{"date":"2014-11-05","rating":"2.0","review":"It was popular years ago when there was almost nothing in the arts district, but now the place sucks.

When I found this place I went in through the dining area, so my first glimpse of the place was awesome. Walked in and everyone inside was chatty. We took our seats and sat there looking around until I realized uh we weren't going to be served any time soon lol. Went around and went to order only to be surprised of all the different colored hot dogs and what they were made out of. Crocodile, vile, Buffalo, Rattle snake, and Deer? What?! Also, mango in a hot dog? What?! Wish I could have ordered the crocodile one, but I wanted my first experience to be a good one and also I did not want to upset my stomach. I ordered the Lamb hot dog with jalapeno slices, my friends ordered the Mango with Jalapeno and bell pepper slices and I can't remember what my friend ordered though.    My hot dog tasted like regular sausage, my friends mango one had a phenomenal taste! The other hot dog was like eh... The fries were goood. They don't disappoint at all. The beer selection was good also. It's pricey there, but worth it. The ambiance is real good. The waiters were real nice and friendly, I liked that they were dressed like regular people. But just like L.A... the parking sucks.

And of course, no Wurstküche meal would be complete without Belgian fries (absolutely to die for - I would request this as part of my last meal).

When you walk in it's feels totally hipster but still inviting. The line was a bit long when we got there around 1 PM but the workers were really helpful and made sure everyone had a menu and was helped as quick as possible. After you order you walk back to the right of the sausage display case where you can sit in the big \"beer hall\" looking area or outside on the patio. The have all these different kinds of mustard on the table (and ketchup) which was legit! Spicy mustard, whole grain mustard, plain yellow mustard... craziness.They provide free cucumber infused water which was very refreshing, I think I may try to do that at home it was so good. The wait for our food was kind of long, but I think it was because there were a lot of order before us. We ordered one rattlesnake sausage, one rabbit veal sausage and 1 groot fries (large) which came with 2 dipping sauces. We chose the tzatziki and the chipotle aioli. My rabbit veal was very flavorful and yummy! The bread they used was great too and I liked the toppings of onions and peppers. My mom loves the rattlesnake one so she always gets that one haha. The fries looked overcooked when they came out but they were actually really good! Too much salt though, and the tzatziki didnt' taste like what I was used to but plain old ketchup did the trick!This place can get pricey if you don't watch out.

And I want it with some awesome beer. Now. Well thanks to Wurstkuche, you can eat some tasty exotic sausages if that's your thing or a regular bratwurst. Their fries are sooo good and with a large order, you receive two dipping sauces. The chipotle aioli is h-e-a-v-e-n. They have a great selection of beers. Actually they have one of the best beer selections that I have come across in the two years that I have been living in LA. Wurstkuche has community style tables in the back of the restaurant or if you're lucky, you can snag a small table outside in the patio. Also, everything is self serve (water, utensils) and they have several types of mustards to choose from to compliment your choice of sausage.

I love the rattlesnake and gator sausage with jalepeno peppers because, with myself included, that's four links of the food chain and I consider that quite an accomplishment. Sometimes I choose the pork and alligator andouille sausage, because it makes me feel daring and adventurous, and of course Belgian fries because the banality of potatoes creates an interesting incongruity when paired with gator. Also I like fries and they have them there and they are good. I typically avoid the truffle fries, though, not because theirs aren't tasty, but because truffle fries are too trendy right now and I like to go against the grain.Service is friendly, but not too friendly. Sometimes it gets a bit congested, but they seem to handle it like champs.More outdoor seating would be nice, but there's not much they can do about that and they do the best they can with the real estate."},{"date":"2013-01-14","rating":"4.0","review":"= SAUSAGES and BEER.  2x YUM =Okay, I think most people are tired of the same boring turkey sausages, chicken sausages, blah blah blah.   How would you like to drink a nice cold beer while munching on an exotic sausage?Yes, Wurstkuche is almost too good to be true.  They have a nice selection of exotic sausages ranging from buffalo, duck, alligator, rattlesnake to rabbit meat.  The most popular exotic sausage is probably the Rattlesnake & Rabbit.  I love it when I can munch on my not-so-everyday meat.  But no worries, folks.  If you are not the adventurous type, they have regular bratwurst sausages for you too!"},{"date":"2014-01-13","rating":"5.0","review":"Interesting and amazing dogs and beer.Long line on the weekends.... get there before 6pm or after 9:30pm.DJ on the weekends.....LOVE IT HERE"},{"date":"2013-12-23","rating":"3.0","review":"great customer service!

They have good system going where they hand you menus while you are waiting and offer to take your drink order while you wait in line. Pretty smart, well thought out business tactic that works. Why not have a beer while standing in line? They have quite a few options for sausages and love the add-ons. Fries were tasteful and complemented the sausages. Plenty of beer to choose from and at a reasonable price. When we walked towards the back through the semi long hall, and eventually heard the noise and all the people it was like Wow! I did not expect it to look like this. So fun to see that type of atmosphere. Totally packed, everyone enjoying themselves and having a good time drinking beers and eating some damn good food. There is an additional bar in the dining area where you can also order more brew. Mustards were on point and the chipotle aioli sauce was very memorable.

The lamb and Mediterranean spices dog had just enough lamb flavor and a good kick of flavor! the bockwurst was nice and juicy. good solid dog and the duck sausage was equally as flavorful and juicy!their hogs come with a choice of two toppings, either grilled onions,spicy peppers, sweet peppers or sauerkraut. their fries are double fried thick cut fries! dont expect super crispy fries, but they are equally as good with piping hot fluffy centers and a good amount of seasoning on them! the small  order of fries comes with one choice of dipping sauce, whereas the big order comes with two sauces. My personal favorite sauces are chipotle aioli and curry ketchup! The beer selection for draft is pretty lengthy! TIP- not all beers are of the same serving size!"},{"date":"2015-01-16","rating":"4.0","review":"Not that impressive as I expected. Sausage is just ok, not that super delicious as what I expected.

If you come and are starving, you need at least 2 hot dogs to fill ya up. Go with the Mango Jalepeño with Carmelized onions and sweet peppers. Be sure to also pick up the fries. If you choose to sit inside it's similar to eating in an elementary school cafeteria. Eat out back with the hipsters.

Not only are the gourmet sausages at this place ze BOMB (dot com), but the beer selection's the shiz as well! Now that I can legally drink in this country, I am happy to announce that I was able to try a beer (the hefe- weissbier), and boy was it big/tasty.  I love me some white beer because it's a tad sweet, but also full of tasty flavor. I kind of wish I was more of a beer connoisseur so I could describe to you precisely what I was tasting, but as I'm just a beer noob, all I can say is that the selection is good, and the beer is refreshingly delicious. I had 500 ml for $6. Not bad, I think, especially since I just came from Australia, and beer there is so hella expensive I wish I didn't enjoy it so much. I came last spring for some sausage, and I recall that I ordered the sweet philippino one.  My memory's a bit hazy now, but I do remember that I loved the sausage but felt 'meh' about the fries.  Like Tiff Z. said, they were pretty thick, and I also enjoy a thinner, crisper fry. Elsewise, everything about Wurstkuche is great. It's a nice place to catch up with old friends over a simple (yet gourmet) dinner of sausages and beer.

They also have a good selection on beer, and if you don't know what you want then ask the bartender, they usually have a good sense of what you'll like.

But all in all, I'm not a fan of minimalist hotdogs. I liked the idea of exotic meats for some of the sausages, but I really couldn't identify the taste of rattlesnake versus that of rabbit. The toppings are pretty much what you get scooped on from the afore-mentioned Acapulco hotdog carts, with a little less personality. Bottom line: Overrated and fairly bland. Find a food truck, you'll appreciate the experience more.  I've had worse hotdogs, for sure.

You might wonder why get something so simple when there's soooo many fancy options, but sometimes simple is good. And they are pros at making a good brat/bock here.I thought the fries were also delicious. Definitely helps :)THE BEER: A+Delicious imported German/Belgian goodness.

You get the idea.  Not for the size.  An Asian man will be envious of the size, but will make a black man laugh.  The veggie dog was pasty like it came out of a play doh press.  If you're here to hang with your hipster friends that hasn't washed his/her hair or did laundry in weeks to bump chests bragging about who got the better deal or best weekly find at the salvation army or goodwill than this is the perfect spot to congregate.  To enjoy a quality hot dog or sausage got somewhere else.  Buy a pack at Costco.  Fyi...they buy their exotics from American Fish and other meat distributors, not direct from the local artisan makers.  shhhh....Have fun in that line."},{"date":"2014-06-20","rating":"5.0","review":"Great brats, all kinds of weiners to choose from.

We went on a weekday so parking on the streets was easy. And from the walk, we saw pretty cool graffiti on the wall. There was barely a line so we quickly got to order. I felt in an 'exotic' mood so I ended up getting the rattlesnake and rabbit.VIBE/PLACE:+very minimal style decor+/- the sausages are displayed but don't look too appealing+menu is very straight forward+ there is a hallway to the right of the register. It seems kind of hidden, but you go down the hallway and there's lots of seating (reminded me of a cafeteria kind of haha) and also an outdoor patio as well+sort of had the hipster vibe+met two nice guys and talked about occupyLA with them and the LA scene hahaFOOD/SERVICE:Ordered the RATTLESNAKE & RABBIT because one of the reviews said it was juicy and flavorful+the person I ordered from suggested the two toppings (caramelized onions and sweet peppers) for me and followed his recommendations+it wasn't too busy when we were there during the weekday so it was nice and mellow. Got to collect all the different mustard bottles and put them on our table :P+they bring your order to you and it was really quick.VERDICT:I honestly wouldn't know how rattlesnake/rabbit would taste like so everything here is based on their integrity right haha. Although I didn't have high hopes for the hotdog, I was still a little disappointed because the sausage wasn't as flavorful and juicy as I would like. Basically all I could think of was \"meh, it's ok, but hotdogs really are just hotdogs\"..... except I think dirty, greasy, juicy dogs or hot dog stands outside a club after a night of drinking and dancing are the absolute bests!I would come again to try out other hotdogs though.

I think they are Tofurky or Field Roast quality.  I had the Italian with sauerkraut and caramelized onions.  Most of the mustards on the tables were too spicy/yucky for me, so I went with plain yellow.  The bread is not the typical soft hot dog bun, but I think that is because some of the combos are heavy and need a stronger bread.The husband got the rattlesnake and rabbit version, and I couldn't help but try a crumb.  It was completely different from anything I've ever tasted... if you're feeling adventurous, go for it!They also have a lot of interesting soft drinks to choose from... cucumber, elderflower, some sort of orange jigger... hmm."},{"date":"2014-02-17","rating":"1.0","review":"There's a good beer and sausage selection served with delicious bread.  Fries and dipping sauces were good too.  Unfortunately, while waiting in line, you will be barked at and harangued by an angry woman in charge of something for the first time in her life.  The words \"Please stand in the corner!\" were literally yelled at me.  Maybe put up a rope to guide the queue?  Otherwise, just build a little gestapo tower in the center of the lobby and give her a BB gun rifle to finish authenticating the german dining experience."},{"date":"2015-01-04","rating":"4.0","review":"I'm giving only 4 stars because of ups and downs of this visit lol.

(FYI we were not greeted and the bf went to the front to get a menu, maybe the guy didn't see us when we walked in??) Once you're drinking your beer in line and place your order, they hand you a red triangle number thing to place on your table to spot you in the eating area in the back. We sat down and were entertained with the different sauces and the the fact that water was so yummy since it had a hint of cucumber. From there we waited ,waited and waited. Let's just say we saw a couple sit, get their food, eat it and left lol. At that point , we were ready to go to the front but one of the waitresses came up to ask about our food and came back to give us free fries because of the wait = we were content . 10 min after that our food arrives and the manager came over and took care of the whole bill and apologized which pretty much left us stunned. In conclusion , the fries are amazing, the food was alright but its all the different options that I think keeps people coming.

I was tight on money so I didn't get an exotic dog and went with the gourmet Filipino Maharlika--it was hands down delicious. My friends got the duck and bacon, rattlesnake and rabbit, and crocodile and pork which are all on their exotic menu; all three of those were pretty good too so I don't think you can go wrong with any of the sausages they have here. Read the description on the menu--it helps.Aside from the sausage we also got fries with curry ketchup and pesto mayo. 75 cents each which is a bit pricey but we didn't even use all of it...should have put some on the hotdog. The curry ketchup is alright and the pesto mayo is a must try if you are a pesto lover.You order in the front which is well lit but you eat in the back which is a club-like environment. There are hardly any lights in there but it is manageable. If you want to take a picture for instagram then go to the front where there is light. Not sure if it is like this during the day (probably isn't). There is also loud music playing so you can't really talk to any of your friends.

There's plenty of street parking, so your only worry is if you suck at paralleling. FOOD: I ordered the Duck with ___ (I forget!), large order of belgian fries with pesto mayo and bluecheese bacon walnut (did I mix up the order?). My friend went with a good ol' bratwurst, but both were delicious! The bun was nice and toasted to perfection, and the sweet onions and hot peppers complimented the hotdog very well. I also exercised my 21-ness (YES!) and ordered the Forest Apple Ale. DELICIOUS. It tastes like a grown up's apple cider. Total cost of the meal? ~$19 Not so excited about that, but hey, that's life.ATMOSPHERE: Order first, then wait for your food while you drool staring at other people eat. The place is full of long tables but also has a couple of small tables lining its walls. Great for both large groups and cute hipster dates.SERVICE: Everyone was super nice and attentive, not that they needed to be. Everything is laid out for you (ketchup&mustards).

I was eating veg at the time and tried each of their more popular veg sausages - the Italian vegetarian and the apple sage vegetarian - both were excellent, and this is coming from a most of the time carnivore who likes really good sausages. From a flavor standpoint, they tasted like authentic meat sausages, which is unprecedented in my book. I did sweet peppers and caramelized onions on both and loved the combination. I will definitely be back to try all of the unique fare including the rabbit, rattlesnake, and the alligator if it gets put back on the menu (it was out at the time of my visit).The truffle fries were also exceptional, and pair perfectly with the curry catsup, which was the most unique and delicious take on catsup in recent memory. Round this out with a wide selection of craft beers, and we've got a winner. 1 star off for price, as I paid nearly 30 dollars for 2 dogs, small fries and a beer. Valet was $5, so that puts my meal into the mid $30 range.Honestly though, I can't blame them for charging what they charge - they can barely fight the demand off as it is, they deserve to be successful."},{"date":"2014-04-13","rating":"3.0","review":"$6.5 for a sausage is kinda rip off. Honestly the food here is not even that good. Id give it 2 stars but since the decor and cashier grl was super nice. I gave it a 3 star.Ordered the Santa Fe jack cheese sausage, sun dried tomato and mozzarella sausage and double dipped fries.Buns were not soft kinda tough to eat. Portion of the sausage was just the size of reg hot dogs you get at ralphs. The santa fe had a lil spice to it but wasnt tasty. Sun dried tomato and mozzarella sausage had a good flavor but not something to die for. Fries were the thick kinds w lots of potatoes but was a bit bitter. Curry ketchup was kinda unique. Pesto mayo is ok, nothing special.Did not try the beer. The location is hard to find parking fyi. I def wouldnt care to come back."},{"date":"2014-02-14","rating":"5.0","review":"Um, obsessed.

The novelty wears off pretty quickly and you realize that Wurstkuche has overpriced beer and fancy hotdogs stuffed with random meat. My biggest gripe with the place is that they don't change out the beer offerings here. Don't get me wrong, the beer they have is good, but some variety and a rotating list would be nice.

Here was our order (and, please note, this order is usually EPIC, hence why we always order this):1. Bockwurst with caramelized onions and hot peppers= on this one, the bock was on point, but someone must have neglected the onions because they came out blackened (in the worst way possible). Had to wash the taste of burn away with a fair amount of Franziskaner, then scrape away the toppings, which essentially left a plain jane bock, which isn't as enjoyable.2. Mango Jalapeno with sweet and spicy peppers= luckilly we avoided the onion debacle on this one, but the sausage tasted undercooked or something, as the turkey and chicken inside seemed almost raw toward the center of the dog. This one was mine, so I made the judgment call to eat it, despite recommendations to send it back. 3. Duck & Bacon with caramelized onions and sauerkraut= onions were an issue here, so ditto to the explanation above, except substitute the Franz with the Berliner Weisse.4. Vegetarian dog with sweet and spicy peppers= not a problem with this one. Also ordered two large orders of truffle fries. Fries came burnt, and with wrong sauces. We had to send that back, and thought they would send new fries out right away...wrong. 30 minutes later, as we had been long done with the sausage situation and our beers empty, lo and behold came the fries.We'd paid for em so we took em to go, but the moment had truly passed.Hoping this was a fluke, but hopefully this gets resolved."},{"date":"2014-04-06","rating":"4.0","review":"A very nice hot dog / gastropub restaurant complete with some unique foods.Here are some must orders if it is your first time here:1) rattlesnake rabbit sausage - don't let the exotic name turn you away...its actually super duper delicious! plus, not everyone can say that they have had rattlesnake rabbit sausage.

The choices range from familiar (bratwurst) to adventurous (rattlesnake). No matter what sausage and toppings you choose, you have to get the fries. They are delicious and hard to stop eating. They have a number of dips for the fries, though I always get the aioli. I'm drooling just thinking of it. In the back, there's a lot of communal seating and a huge bar. They have got a ton of beers on tap and they are glad to serve you samples if you ask. Try to go on an off-hour if you come with a group.

Haven't tried any of the exotic sausages, but of the sausages I've tried, I recommend the following: Austin Blues, Bratwurst, Chicken and Apple, Filipino Maharlika, and Louisiana Hot Link. The only one I wouldn't recommend is the Bockwurst, because it's kinda bland and has an off-putting grainy texture, reminiscent of Oscar Meyer bologna.My favorite toppings are the caramelized onions and the sweet peppers, because they're flavorful, yet don't overpower the taste of the meat. Big selection of mustards. The whole grain, Dijon, and spicy brown are my favorites. The honey mustard has a funky taste to it...The fries and dipping sauces are fantastic! I didn't think I'd like the bleu cheese/bacon/walnut dip, but it is very tasty. My other favorite dips are the chipotle aioli and the curry ketchup. The only dip I disliked was the Thai peanut--I normally love Thai peanut sauce, but the ginger is way too overpowering in this one!Huge variety of beers and fancy sodas. If you want beer, I recommend the Franziskaner, Weihenstephaner Dunkel, or any of the Chimays. For soda, try the spiced apple cider. It tastes like apple pie filling, but isn't grossly sweet at all."},{"date":"2014-05-31","rating":"5.0","review":"What more can you ask for than a tall glass of beer, a juicy bratwrust in a warm bun topped with sweet onions and sauerkraut, and thick cut Belgian fries?   This is my go-to place when out of town friends come for a visit, and they always love it. Of course, it's easier to come when it's not peak hours, but despite the crowds at those hangry hours, I've been consistently impressed by the personable beverage service while in line. It makes the experience that much more enjoyable, and make the line out the door not seem so bad. Also, they're quite understanding of beer mishaps. I once had one of their plastic labels on their 5+ kinds of condiments fall into my beer glass, and they were more than happy to replace my entire glass no questions asked. That gets a gold star in my book. The only minor complaint I have about the place is the lack of seating and loudness, but of course, going at off hours makes it less of an issue. The long tables get crowded very quickly and you'll often find yourself in the company of strangers or squeezed at the end of the bench seat between tables or you'll have to wait a while for a free table, but I like the cozy atmosphere.

If I could have had a bite of every sausage, I would do it but my belly could only fit 2 on that particular day. I liked the Hot Italian a lot more as it was juicier/fattier but it was interesting to try the Snake & Rabbit combo. I don't remember what beer I got, but you can leave it up to the bartender to select a brew to your taste as you describe to them. You can taste it before ordering, and at a reasonable price.

It did have that sausage kick to it but it was very light at the same time! Also ordered fries with it, and I had a Chimay. Sausage just goes so well with beer! Especially bold beer like Chimay.

Busy after work since some nearby professionals frequent this place with buddies. They also serve beer so it's a Sausage Fest calling. The staff is okay; or at least the cashier didn't seem particularly friendly.Overall, it's a great place to try but I don't think it's my kind of cuisine. It can get busy at certain times of the day so plan accordingly. I may try this place again since it's somewhat unfair to review it when the food isn't served fresh fresh (ate it 15-30 min later).

There's a myriad of choices...oh, what to settle on? Don't be intimidated to try something outlandish here. Oddly enough, Rattlesnake/Rabbit is my favorite, then Kielbasa, followed by Louisiana Hot Link, Bratwurst and Bockwurst. I normally top mine with Sweet Peppers and Caramelized Onions.

These fries rank in my all-time favorite fries list!Which sausage would I stay away from? That has to be the Alligator/Pork. This sausage is way tooooo hearty and leaves you masticating the tough alligator meat a while with every bite.

This place is well known for it's vast beer selection. As a non-alcohol beverage kinda guy, all I have to say is, if brewskis are your \"cup of tea\" (sorry for the inappropriate, lame cliché)...knock yourself out!As for the dining area, you'll recall that good old fashion high school feeling of eating in the cafeteria, but only this one has a cool DJ mixing the tunes on his MacBook Pro. There is a tiny 'private' dining area of which I've had the privilege of dining in before. The main dining area with tables and benches are tightly spaced and you'll get to know a stranger a lot more than you'd like. It's rather kind of fun though eaves dropping on obscure conversations! You should try it...I highly recommend it! ;) Furthermore, the tables are covered with butcher paper equipped with writing utensils, so you can channel your inner Leonardo da Vinci and let it run amuck!This sausage fest can get expensive real quick, but I highly recommend you try it more than once, this way, you can truly come to a conclusion as to whether you genuinely like Wurstküche or not.

If you weren't lucky to find meter parking, there is a parking lot nearby, but you had to pay a flat fee. The place is small, but it has a good amount of space for eating. There was a room full of long picnic benches and tables that reminded me of my elementary and high school days.We ordered the rattlesnake and rabbit, belgian fries, and bleu cheese bacon and walnut sauce. I got to say that the rattlesnake and rabbit tasted really delicious despite of the name. It didn't taste like chicken, but it was very meaty and filled with flavor! I wonder if the sausage came from the rattlesnake that ATE the rabbit, but who knows! The fries were delectable, but it was hard to finish them off without having a little flavor such as their different variety of ketchup and mustard to the mix. The bleu cheese bacon and walnut sauce tasted amazing and is definitely worth a try. They also have a great selection of Belgium and German beer for those who love to drink beer!Overall, Wurstküche is highly recommended for those who are adventurous and want to eat something new!"},{"date":"2014-03-19","rating":"4.0","review":"Having spent a couple summers in Germany and enjoying their famous street cart wursts there, I was really excited when my friend introduced me to this place as I have never had a sausage/hot dog that compares to the ones over there. First, I really like how this place is set up. The decor is very modern and definitely has the whole hipster vibe. I ordered the mango jalapeno sausage with caramelized onions and sauerkraut... SO GOOD. It has that specific snap/bite when you first bite into it (if that makes sense). It wasn't super fatty either which is something I liked. You can taste the sweetness of the mango and spiciness of the jalapeno as well. The toppings were also done to perfection. I never really enjoyed sauerkraut as I feel its a bit too overwhelming (too sour/too watery--soggy buns), but this one was really good. I also recommend getting the Belgian fries, not only is it massive, you get really unique dipping sauces. I enjoyed the thai peanut one. I didn't order one, but they have a good selection of beers. I tried a bit of the strawberry one my friend got and it was super tasty as well."},{"date":"2015-01-20","rating":"4.0","review":"The fries and dips are superb!"},{"date":"2014-12-03","rating":"5.0","review":"I cant stop to eat Wurstels :D"},{"date":"2015-01-30","rating":"5.0","review":"Have been here a few times before.

They're known for their plethora of grilled sausages ranged from the classics, gourmet, to the exotics; and a few choices of toppings and condiments served on a freshly baked roll. Interested diners should expect to order food at one end of the restaurant where the open kitchen is supported by a well ventilated system and a narrow hallway that eventually leads to a spacious dining room equip with a full bar. We first tried the Alligator, Pork, Andouille Sausage ($7.50) that came with a mild hickory smoked flavor, thick casing, and dry rubbery texture. I was unsure the extent the alligator meat had the play in the dry texture, but the shriveled sausage should have been tender given the amount of pork that was included. The combination of flavor didn't work as well as expected, and rather, the texture reminded me of a poorly assembled veggie dog. I didn't think it was worth the price, especially given the size in relations to the thicker hot dog buns, which isn't saying much.We also tried the Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapeno Sausage ($7.50). The size was still diminutive compared to the ones we saw before it reached the grill. The flavor was much better as it was mildly spicy, buttery, and pointed. We added caramelized onions and sweet peppers on both sausages and next time you can count on me to try the sauerkraut. Condiment-wise, I wasn't too fond of their whole grain mustard since I prefer a sharper taste for contrast. I've had less exotic, but more voluptuous and juicy sausages with better buns elsewhere. However, this tasty sausage was a winner!Lastly, our Groot Fries ($5.50) came with nice bulky pieces where I can still taste a mouthful of potatoes. It was made the way I prefer them and the thick creamy chipotle aioli dipping sauce was far better than the sweet bbq sauce. I didn't want beer so I opted for the Cherry Ginger Soda ($3.50) which was refreshing.The interesting decor of steel, bricks and wood was simple and yet striking along with several long communal tables to make this place a nice hangout for groups. The vibe was casual and has the making of a hipsterish gastropub. The experience was eye opening but also expensive. Service was brief but friendly given the pay first, self seating arrangement.  I'd be interested in returning to try their Filipino Pork Maharika Sausage and Duck, Bacon and Jalapeno Sausage."},{"date":"2014-06-11","rating":"5.0","review":"Food n brews are on point.

I thought it was good... but not as good as I expected.I've heard of long lines to order and fights for tables just to eat here so when I came up to this place and saw that there weren't a lot of people, I was thrilled. Getting a table was easy. Waited in line for about 10 minutes before I could put my order in and apparently, I'm lucky because 10 minutes is a short wait time compared to others' experiences.Food was good but I think it was overpriced. I had the mango jalapeno sausage with onions and sweet peppers. Fruli was so delicious! Strawberry beer... Who knew!? My brother and friend had the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage and they liked it. I like their beer selections and their belgian fries are SO good. Chipotle aioli and blue cheese walnut and bacon dipping sauces are yummy!I would come back here although I don't find this place worth waiting more than 30 minutes for!

Having the Alligator and Rabbit sausage with a DeKonnick while catching up with three close girl friends and my hottie boy friend (none of whom I'd seen in a very very long time), I was SOOOO HAPPY to be back in California! Talking Wurstkuche to friends abroad was like talking legend.. The first few times I'd come to Wurstkuche several years back there was rarely a line, and the friendly hipsters behind the register allowed me to sample several beers until I made my selection. In the Arts District of downtown LA, the opening of Wurstkuche was like the opening of my gastropub dreams. Free wifi, which is killer cool. I actually came once with my laptop and ate/ drank/ computed for an entire afternoon by myself until the cafeteria-style benches got filled with tattooed, pierced, edge-heads. I suppose it might've seemed strange to see me there alone on my computer, but let's be honest, hipsters don't *really* notice anyone but themselves, right?? ZING~!! just kidding, I love you guys!Actually, the bartender kept me company from afar, saying hello every now and then and keeping my beer flowing.Yeah, this place is worth the excitement~!

Most notable were the Rattlesnake and Rabbit,  Pheasant, Duck and straight up Brotworst.

This place has a great tap selection of interesting brews and a comparable sausage case with flavors for every person/mood.  Feeling adventurous?  Try the rattlesnake sausage.  While the sausages and beer are the main event here, the belgian fries are what keeps me coming back.  Thick and substantial, these fries are for fans of potato flavor.

I love having a beer or two with my meal here. For the non-beer peeps out there, they also have a tasty cider on the menu.  If you just prefer a water cup, their self-serve water station is very refreshing!  I THINK they add cucumber to their water, so that was a pleasant surprise the first time I had a sip.Entrees:  I've had their Mango Jalapeno, Austin Blues, & Kielbasa; out of the 3, I'd say I like the Austin Blues best with Mango Jalapeno trailing not too far behind.  You're also allowed 2 toppings - caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, or spicy peppers.  I'm not a fan of mustard, but for all you mustard fans out there - each table comes with ketchup & 3 types of mustard! Fries: Boy, oh boyyyy, their fries are the main reason why I come back here.  You can request that the fries come drizzled with white truffle oil.  If you're here with a friend or 2, order a large order of fries - it's definitely enough to be shared.  You can also order 2 dipping sauces to go with it.  My personal faves are the pesto mayo & chipotle aioli.   I ordered the curry ketchup once, but the curry + ketchup conconction confused my taste buds, so I haven't ordered it since.  Seating: I've found that there's usually an abundance of seating.  There are a few 2-4 seaters, but a lot of the larger tables are kinda cafeteria seating.  There's also outdoor seating available for those gorgeous LA days & summer nights."},{"date":"2013-12-26","rating":"5.0","review":"Highly Recommended.Every time I come to Wurstkuche I feel hungry.

This is a fantastic eatery in an odd place. it's tucked in between an industrial area and a residential zone in a strange intersection where 4 streets come together from weird angles.  There's a line out the door that gets longer and shorter throughout the evening but never actually goes away. Once you make it through the front door you're greeted by a host that will explain the process and also offer you a beer while you wait!!  The process:  You order at the front counter and then head down the long hallway to the dining room to await one of the lovely ladies that will bring your food! Here's the catch... if you aren't sure how hungry you are then order big. If you decide round two is in order... Back of the line!! It's better to fill up and take some home than risk getting back in the unpredictable line. In the dining room there IS a bar where you can get another drink without going back outside to wait. The Food:  The food is a little bit of heaven on a bun. I ordered a bratwurst with caramelized onions and grilled hot pepper blend and the Austin Blues also with caramelized onions but with grilled sweet peppers. Both were extremely good and entirely different. The fries are fantastic and come with exotic sauces. I chose the Curry Ketchup and was not disappointed.

I love the ambiance...almost reminds me of how it would like in junior high where strangers would be forced to sit next to each other and mingle. There would be some individual tables and individual chairs available if you were lucky, but the occasional meet and greet is always fun especially with german beers involved. Speaking of beers, their Spaten Optimator is the way to go. I always order this drink at least once per visit and would try other belgian after the Optimator.The service there is great with friendly employees. I love how they quickly move the lines because at first glance it is always a long line, but they fast and efficient. The only one issue I would have is that most of their sausages are over cooked with some ash which doesnt seem too pleasant.

The rattlesnake was pretty tasty. I didn't find it weird or exotic tasting at all. I came in last weekend with a Blackboard Eats deal ($17 for a bbe exclusive sausage + beer + large order of fries) We got to sample the lamb sausage while waiting in line. It was SUPER GOOD with such amazing flavors. I wish I had ordered that one, because I decided to go with the pheasant, and it really wasn't as delicious as the lamb. The pheasant was good, but the flavors just didn't hit me the way the flavors of the lamb sausage did. I topped off my sausage with some caramelized onions and sweet peppers. I kinda wish I had gone with the spicy peppers instead. The fries are SO good here. I paid the extra $2 for the truffle glaze and didn't really taste a HUGE difference. I'd say the regular fries are good enough with out the truffle glaze. I normally prefer skinny fries, but something about these twice fried steak fries  hit my taste buds and my belly just right. Plus the chipotle aoili and the pesto mayo i got with fries were soooo good. I especially loved the chipotle aoili (even tho I am a huge pesto lover). The aoili was smooth and had an awesome kick of smokey chipotle flavor. It made the already delicious fries even better and even more addicting. I went with the Fruili beer this time. GIRLS: YOU GUYS WILL LOVE THIS STUFF. It tastes just like strawberries. SO YUM. They have all sorts of German and Belgian beers on tap, the servers here know quite a bit about them, so feel free to ask them for help if you are having trouble deciding on a beer!The only reasons I can't give this place 5 stars is for the inconvenient parking and the open seating. I hate having to hover to a spot to sit. When it gets crowded, be ready to sit VERY close to the party next to you. You can't be concerned about your personal bubble at this place when it gets busy. Also, the music in here can get pretty loud, and the acoustics in this restaurant make it even harder to have a conversation with the people in your party. I've heard its different at lunch time, but if you wanna have a convo with friends, try snagging a spot in the patio area. Don't be turned off by the long line, it moves pretty quickly. I'd recommend that one person in your party go into the dining room to hunt for a spot to sit while the rest of your party waits to order."},{"date":"2013-03-23","rating":"4.0","review":"Really cool spot hidden in Downtown LA. I had a Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle and a Crocodile Sausage. Both delicious, but I piled both with sweet and spicy peppers and onions and most fell off. They say you can pick two toppings, but you really just need one.On a side note, amazing fries and a shockingly amazing blue cheese walnut & bacon dip. If anything, try this place out for the uniqueness of flavors."},{"date":"2013-12-01","rating":"4.0","review":"I really love this joint, primarily for their awesome sausages.  I just really like the variety they have as well as the simpler fare to fit your mood.They've also got a great rotating tap list and a wide variety of tasty bottles to choose from as well.  I'd avoid the busy hours but really enjoy myself with the properly timed visit.  It can get quite packed and waiting out a table can be an ordeal at times.My favorite is probably the rabbit/veal and rabbit/rattlesnake and are always cooked well.  The sausages always give a nice snap and are juicy as can be.  I really appreciate the different types of mustard available at the table.  Just snatch a bottle up before it wanders too far for your reach as they're communal."},{"date":"2013-01-19","rating":"4.0","review":"I love the variety of exotic sausages here but the only downside is that you have a limited selection of foods to choose from: sausages in buns, fries, and beer.  I know I shouldn't complain but it does get a little heavy so I kind of crave a salad or some veg at the end of my meal.Regardless, the quality of the products served here is outstanding.  Each sausage is grilled up fresh, tucked in a fresh roll, and topped with onions/sauerkraut/peppers.  Mustard is self serve on the tables/benches in back.  The fries come with your choice of dipping sauce- I have tried almost all of them- very unique, very tasty.  The beer selection is pretty good here although maybe a big pricey since these aren't your typical beers on tap.  Wurstkuche also serves a limited selection of desserts but I haven't tried any because I get way too full from the carb load here.Overall, I highly recommend coming here if you haven't already.  Be prepared for a line out the door during peak hours and crowded tables in the back.  You may have to fight for a seat or make new friends at the long benches/tables but the food is well worth it."},{"date":"2014-02-22","rating":"4.0","review":"I love Los Angeles for so many reasons, cool food and vibes being among the top ones.  Wurstkuche is all of these things, in a happening part of DTLA.  They even offer three or it may be four vegan sausage options!  The sauces and toppings are delish, and the variety of interesting beers just as good.  I tried an organic ale one week day afternoon when my man and I were down there seeing an hilarious reading/performance? of this guy who was trying to emulate bukowski at the post office, typing from the novel 'post office' out of his truck.  he was cool, and funny, but the Wurstkuche meal beforehand was much better.  Love may be a dog from hell, but you can never go wrong with beer and (in our case, vegan) brats."},{"date":"2014-02-21","rating":"4.0","review":"Came here after a tipsy night at an art gallery party in the Arts District! I fell in love with Wurstkuche, it totally hit those late night cravings for something a bit greasy and delicious! I ordered the Mango and Jalapeno dog with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. I asked an employee which two toppings would fare well with the Mango and Jalapeno dog, and she mentioned the toppings above. She was friendly and helpful! I then added a bit of spicy mustard to my hot dog and finished it off with some tasty German beer! My take on the Mango and Jalapeno dog? It tasted good, but a bit too sweet for my liking. I think it was also the fact that I added sweet peppers onto my dog. Next time, I would love to try the Rabbit and Rattlesnake dog (thats the one my friend always gets). Overall, fun hipster crowd, great for groups, awesome selection of brews (must try all the different kinds) and the hotdogs kick-ass.

With drinks, fries, and a hot dog, you can get close to $20- the atmosphere is LOUD. There's sometimes a DJ inside and it is IMPOSSIBLE to hear anyone talk or have a decent conversation. Try to sit outside if you can get seating.- the setting is very HIPSTER. It has a nice view of downtown in the background and is right next to the Pie Hole and other hipster stores. A nice chill area to be around.-The hot dogs are very meaty. If that's what you like then they're great- very seasoned and rich in meat. Not like the weinerschnitzel hot dogs that are easy to chew, these are larger.- the fries are meh.

I had my wisdom tooth pulled a week before and this was the first time I went out to eat. I couldn't have alcohol because of the pain killers and couldn't drink bubbly to avoid messing up the blood clot over the extraction site (sorry about the graphic image). Unfortunately, they did not have any non-alcoholic non-carbonated drinks except for water. I would have loved some juice or non-bubbly soda...

On the gourmet side there is about 10 different choices, just to name a few like: 1) mango jalepeno, 2) sun dried tomato and mozzarella, 3) apricot and ginger (which was the chicken/turkey and lamb sausage) Then there is the exotics! 1) buffalo 2) duck and bacon 3) rabbit veal and pork, 4) alligator and pork 5) rattlesnake and rabbit.As much that it looks unusual on the menu the exotics are too hardcore for my taste Lol.My order came down to a Louisiana hot link with sauerkraut and spicy peppers was my choice of toppings, a side of belgium fries, and to top it off with some german brewski and i got the 1809 berliner weisse.The Louisiana hot link was not bad at all, it was tasty, it's not too spicy, the sauerkraut and peppers, also the mustard overcame that.The belgium fries were good! made fresh, crunchy, tasty, not too greasy, my choice of dipping sauce was the curry ketchup, and chipotle ketchup which both were pretty decent.The 1809 berliner weisse was ok, it was tarty, there is sourness involved but still good enough to get a buzz on. They do have quite a good selection of imported beers to choose from, most of them german beers, but it's better to ask the people that work there, and ask what those beers are about because they'll tell you what taste better, and even though they told me my drink choice may not taste as good, i still wanted that beer choice haha!Overall cool gastropub, perfect to bring friends here for that social get together, you have a variety of sausages, dipping sauces for your fries, and beers to choose from, for whichever your mood or taste buds desire don't eat those sausages too fast, take your time and enjoy :)"},{"date":"2014-02-03","rating":"4.0","review":"I just went over the weekend and it was a pretty cool hidden spot.

The beer selection will not let you down either, boasting a large and interesting selection of both German and Belgian beers.The drawbacks: parking can be challenging, lines can be somewhat long, and it is a little bit pricey.

The Pheasant is pretty subtle and probably should be eaten with minimal toppings - I'd say JUST the caramelized onions. Doesn't need mustard either. The Duck is another matter. I'd add onions and spicy peppers to an already succulent and spicy sausage. Nice, crispy French Fries.  Great service, too. If you don't have a clue what to drink with your brat. Ask the staff. They will steer you in the right direction. On this latest visit, I enjoyed the Affligem Noël - a spicy amber brew that is nice and complex. After that, I chased it with a Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier, which is TRULY one of the finest beers on the planet.

It is a lot more juicy and moist.IF YOU LOVE THICK CUT FRIES THEN GET THE BELGIUM FRITES!SO GOOD!They also have a wide variety of bottled and draft beers on tap.You order your food at the register and they have tables in the back where you can sit. They also have outdoor patio seating as well. There are communal tables so if you can find a seat, grab it! It's quite refreshing to sit at a communal table for a change. What I also love is that they have a wide selection of mustards, ketchups and sauces that are in squirt bottle dispensers on various tables. I would come here more often if parking wasn't such a hassle to find. There is street parking all around but if you come during dinner rush hour... goodluck to you!

I don't know, I guess sausage always sounds more delicious than it actually is. Either that or I haven't had much really good sausage. Wurstküche was no exception, meaning I'm always excited when I order and rarely as happy when I finally eat it. One thing I really like it all the mustards they had. I'd go just to have something different but otherwise this wouldn't be on my list of places I crave. Sorry."},{"date":"2013-03-24","rating":"4.0","review":"I have nothing but love for this place. For newcomers the set up can be confusing if you enter through the main dining room. I was so confused my first time. We weren't greeted by any of the wait staff, we just kind of wandered, finally we were told to go through this dark hallway to the next room to order. I went rather late at night so there wasn't a line. My second trip, just in time for the dinner rush, the line went outside the door. Don't let that get you down though, it goes rather fast. Once you order, you head back to the main room to hunt for a spot. It's usually not that hard, the communal dining tables are great and people are usually good about not hogging up all the space. I got the filipino maharlika, it was so good. sweet with a little hint of spice. they've got an excellent selections of wursts, if i feel ballsy enough i'll probably try the exotic ones next time. They've got belgian fries, and you can never go wrong with belgian fries.

It was all good... but the fries were mind blowing. Could be because I'm an absolute fries fiend! I ordered them \"well done,\" which made them even crispier and decadent... and the aioli sauce is a great combo! The ambiance is interesting... like a dark cafeteria but it was fully enjoyed. Ordering was fast and easy... don't let the long lines discourage you. They get through it really quick and they even come out to take drink orders while you wait so you can quench your thirst in your pursuit to sausage. At the end of the day...it's sausage and beer. I've had it before and this was just another instance of a happy and full belly. I've heard that some of the other more exotic sausages are not exactly worth the hype... maybe on a second visit? But for the price I'd be really disappointed if it didn't deliver. I say... it's good :)"},{"date":"2013-11-17","rating":"5.0","review":"Delicious suasage, a huge selection of beer on tap, and good indoor plus outdoor tables make for a great venue.  The only real challenges are A) parking is a big challenge, but if you're walking around Little Tokyo this is a good stop and B) the inside seating area can be very noisy.  Service is split: order your food at the counter (there is often a line); drinks are served to you immediately and the food is brought to your table."},{"date":"2014-03-23","rating":"5.0","review":"The best fries in Los Angeles--hands down.

I'd wait till I got to the dining room area before ordering a beer. I know that sounds silly, but their beer menu is longer than their Wurst menu, and therefore takes some qualified support. I mean, I'm very happy with making my way through a beer menu, but under pressure I'm no good. Same with the Wurst selection. Not until I got face-to-face with their physical offerings could I choose between them. The white bockwurst, the red Louisiana Hot Link, the Lamb with Mediterranean spices, etc. The line, the approach is a little more daunting than it really is to wait for your turn, even on a workday lunchtime. So, the line that stretched out the door only took about 5-7 minutes to weave me up to the register. One suggestion later and I was number 50, waiting for my pheasant & fries and moving to the back dining room... $21 lighter (a word on subjective cost, later)...4/5 The back dining room is the type of communal dining experience you get in a lot of Brauerei, Bierstuben, or Hofbräuhaus... Big tables. Just sit down or take a seat at one of the little tables or bar. I chose the bar. A little bit removed from the bustle of the crowds, the bar is actually a great place to sit. You can see the crowds & get the advice of the bartender.  The sausage: 4/5... The pheasant Wurst is a great blend of spices and the slight gaminess of pheasant. It does not overwhelm as duck might and plays well with the herbs de Provence in the sausage and definitely goes with beer. I was not blown away by the dog, nor was I given the option for the choice of peppers/sauerkraut while ordering over the people in front of me. I may have chosen sauerkraut, but was given sweet peppers and onions. The bun feels sensible, but does not seem to add or detract flavor from the sausage. Which may be good, depending how you look at it. Beer selection: 4/5: Out of one of the beers I ordered and a good selection of others. They do not change beers much and recommend finding a good beer and sticking with changing the wurst options to suit. 3.8/5: Cost with beer on the low end of the menu for an exotic sausage is ~$21. Which, though designer, is a bit pricey for a hot dog, but made up for by the care and quality of the product. The ordering process is fine but hectic and they should inform you you can order drinks in the back. I will be back and then jump across the street to Pie Hole. Tried today, but they were out of the pies that I haven't tried yet."},{"date":"2014-11-20","rating":"5.0","review":"GREAT food and drink...Long line but it moved fast.Fries are amazing and the best sausage i have had in a long time.Club type atmosphere at night with a DJ is way cool!

The selection of different types of beers were awesome. I had the vegetarian apple sage sausage. It tasted like any regular sausage, which was nice because I got all the taste but without all the guilt. However the bad thing was it just tasted like any other sausage, nothing special. I added spicy peppers and sauerkraut. Didn't add much taste but added some crunch and texture to the dog. They have ginger beer here too which is cool. My friends had the rabbit & rattlesnake  and said it tasted like any regular sausage, not as exotic as they'd expected either. They give a generous amount for a small order of fries. The pesto mayo sauce is really good! And did I mention beer? Overall, the sausages were alright but I would definitely come back for the beers.

They also have french fries with an assortment of dipping sauces and an impressive beer menu.  I was told all the exotic sausages were delicious. Keeping that in mind, i found myself struggling with the idea of the rattlesnake or the rabbit but I was excited when i saw the duck, bacon, and jalapeno sausage on the menu! The menu describes it as juicy - so SPOT ON! You get two toppings with your sausage... the list includes Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut Sweet Peppers, Spicy Peppers. I topped mine with caramelized onions and spicy peppers. It definitely didn't need any mustard or ketchup because it was so flavorful!Order their french fries! I ordered a larger size of fries to share with my friend and fellow yelper Monica C. It came with two choice of dipping sauces. We had the chipotle aioli and pesto mayo. I love pesto mayo on a sandwich roll but the chipotle aioli was the winner with these belgian fries.For dessert they have one option: a toasted apple pie ice cream sandwich. You order everything up front and you receive a little card to pick up your dessert at the bar when you're ready. I'm sure this prevents the ice cream sandwich from melting while you're enjoying your beer and meal. The ice cream sandwich was nicely kept frozen and didn't melt instantly. I could pick up the cinnamon flavor easily and thought it made the perfect ending to all the strong tasting savory foods.I came during lunch time and found ample meter street parking.

The sausage was good, not great. But then again I went with the fairly generic kielbasa. I will try the rabbit next time. However, the price on the basic sausage was a bit high at $6+.

We actually arrived at the bar portion and was redirected to the other side which is NOT their stated address on Yelp (or anywhere else for that matter ...) where we only found about 3 people in line in front of us to order food.Despite what my friend told me, the must have of the Filipino Sweet Pork sausage (M-something??) I decided on the Rattlesnake and rabbit because that has been thus far my favorite combination.I was definitely too full already, but in true Yelper status I ate some more! So I skipped on the Belgian fries but decided to bring my tag over for some beer instead to go with my sausage. I must say, I wasn't extremely blown away because my sausage was a bit burnt (haha make all the jokes you want!) but I could tell the flavor was there, and I was more thankful that it was overcooked than undercooked since I did not want to walk away with a stomach ache. I feel like this place is a lot of potential and given that ... it will probably be best to come back not at 12:05am when they're just trying to close up shop for the night and actually be able to enjoy a good meal of other kinds of sausage on their offering list as well.

They do offer valet parking at night time which is nice.I had a certain sense that led me to believe that this place was going to live up to its great reputation.... and it certainly did in every way.To start off the venue is sexy! Outside it looks very unassuming... humble if you will...but once you get inside everything looks modern and simple. You order your sausage up front and there will be a well deserved line. While you're waiting one of their kind employees will ask everyone that is waiting if he, or she was planning on ordering any drinks and they will provide each person that would like with a drink. The order/cooking area is separate from the dining areas so if you're a first timer like I was then it's hard to figure out if you'll be able to find a table or not, BUT once you walk to the dining areas (there are a total or 3... 2 inside and 1 outside) then you realize that there is still lots of room to consume! You can either choose their main dining room or there is a small room with individual tables or you could always dine outside on the shaded patio area. They do serve beer up front, but there is a bar in the main dining area serving up beer and wine so one does not have to trek back up front.For a dog I went with one of their premium sausages the Duck and Bacon Sausage: yelp.com/biz_photos/wurs… with sauteed onions and grilled peppers. First off here the sausage to bun ratio was perfect allowing the diner to taste all of the wonderful elements combined.  Now for the toppings. The vegetables were all perfect and flavorful. The house offers many many different types of mustards to top your dog with. The Duck/Bacon Sausage was truly dreamy. I highly recommend this one as it proved quite flavorful with a very welcoming yet not overwhelming bite to it (spiciness!) Pair this with one of their available beers or Sugar Cane Bottled Sodas and you get to experience a little bit of Culinary Heaven. They make their own sausages and the flavor shines through gloriously! Their sausages are made from the familiar to the more exotic meats. You do still want to be careful about the dog you choose because it might change your opinion of the food. I tried the Alligator Dog and I didn't really care for that one. To me it had too much of an assertive \"water animal taste\" to it. I tried the Mango Jalapeno one and it was pretty darn good (4 solid stars,) but I'm so glad I had chosen the one I did.The whole staff was friendly, welcoming, and informative.

It appears to be a tiny place at first; but they have a fairly large seating area hidden in the back. Their menu is straight forward, with a variety of sausages--classic, gourmet, and exotics. I've mainly tried their exotic sausages, which include lamb and Mediterranean spices, buffalo with chipotle peppers, alligator, rattlesnake and rabbit with jalapeno peppers, and rabbit and white wine. My favorites are the lamb and Mediterranean spices and rattlesnake and rabbit with jalapeno peppers. The sausages are decently sized and come with a choice of two toppings (caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, and spicy peppers). They are flavorful and tasty. I like the fact that the exotic meats are not overwhelmingly gamey, but honestly, it was a little difficult differentiating between the meats. Their Belgian fries and dipping sauces are delicious. I like their curry ketchup and sun dried tomato mayo!Prices range from $5.75 for classic sausages to $7.50 for exotic sausages--which is pretty pricey, but given the quality and freshness, it isn't too bad at all.

My favorite is the vegetarian italian, a nice balance of herbs and spice. I'm a vegetarian and have tried everything here that doesn't have meat. These sausages just hit the spot. The veggie mexican chipotle is nice a smoky. The veggie apple sage is on the sweeter side. I like to pair them all with caramelized onions and spicy peppers. The fries are not the focus at this spot but definitely can't be forgotten. They have top quality fries. Some of the best fries in Los Angeles. You can't go wrong with ordering a small order that is enough for two people. The beer selection is better than expected and they all seem to pair well with sausage. I particularly like Old Rasputin and their English cider. They have a nice small selection of specialty sodas, which is a nice touch for those that don't drink. Only downside can sometimes be the noise level. The music can sometimes be too loud and makes it hard to hold any sort of ongoing convo. I understand they are going for a chill backyard type of feel but people need to at least be able to hear each other! Overall, good grub and dranks."},{"date":"2014-10-01","rating":"5.0","review":"The last time I was in the area, I saw a ridiculous line that went out the door and I was curious to see what it was for. Since I was in the area again during my visit, we decided to check it out. Came in on a weekday and there was no line at all. We were literally the only customers ordering. They have a variety of sausages you can choose from. Some of the more exotic ones are rabbit, rattlesnake, alligator. After ordering, you can head to the back and find a seat. I'm assuming it's a lot more difficult to find a seat during their peak hours but we had no trouble at all. Each table has a variety of mustards you can add to your meal. I think the best tasting one was the whole grain mustard. Goes great with the fries, too! We ended up ordering the buffalo sausage which was really lean and juicy. I didn't have too much of it, but it definitely did not disappoint. I do plan on coming back here but probably only on the weekdays to avoid the crowd."},{"date":"2014-12-16","rating":"5.0","review":"OMGOSH! This place is one of the BEST Vegetarian Apple Sage GERMAN Sausage places ever and their truffle fries are amazing!!!!!!! They have many different Vegetarian choices. A great Vegetarian Sausage is so hard to come by so when I tried this place for the first time my taste buds were so happy. Wow with the complement of all the sauces they have for you my favorite being the dijon Mustard and ketchup were so good. They had so many different types of drinks, but the best was the Cucumber Soda!!! The best I have had! I will definately be coming back.The only drawbacks are the long lines of people waiting to order and they could extend their tables inside a bit more and put up more decor."},{"date":"2013-09-15","rating":"4.0","review":"I've always been meaning to try wurstkuche, but never really got around to eating it until yesterday. I was in the area with friends, and decided to try it out. We went around 4pm, and not having eaten anything all day, we were starving and dreading waiting in line (it went out the door past the tree). The line moved pretty quickly, and a waitress was taking drink orders for while you wait. I got the vegetarian italian hot dog with onions and sweet peppers and large fries with chipotle mayo and tzatziki. My sister chose thai peanut and pesto mayo as her sauces, and they were all tasty but a bit heavy (mayo will do that to you lol). In all honesty, I was expecting a better tasting dog- my sausage was burnt (literally black all around) and pretty dry. I really enjoyed drawing on the community seating tables.

They have a live DJ who spins a mashup of ambient/lounge and dance tracks. The clientele is a mix of families, downtown locals, college crowd. The DTLA Arts District hasn't yet been overwrought with tourist e.g.: Abbott Kenny.

One loss is the entryway into new opportunity and joy...AND JOY I FOUND. Another part of my heart came alive as we approached this place. Not the side of me that loves japanese food. But that hidden, mustached, plaid wearing hipster man that doesn't show on the outside (I'm chinese, my mustache is nasty, and I've been too lazy to buy plaid) pushed my asian side to the sidewalked and leaped with joy, prancing into this hipster heaven in the middle of LA. Park benches. Strange hot dogs. Craft beers from germany. several types of mustard. This Chinese hipster forgave his friend. It was in the stream of the Royal Beagle in San Diego or the Rosamunde Sausage/Toronado's combo in San Francisco's Haight district... but, if you can fathom it, more hipster. The only strange thing about this place is its strange obsession with strange polygons. Octagon stools. Octagon tables. Strangely mutilated quadrilaterals for table numbers and serving platters.

I was trying to be semi healthy when I came here so I resisted from the oh so delicious looking fries with all their different kinds of dipping sauces, not to mention their extensive list of draft beers from germany.

I think the atmosphere is what made this restaurant 4 stars and worthwhile. It's very suitable for younger people trying to get together with friends. The food was decent. There was a variety of sausages along with exotic meat. The fries were thick cut and came with a variety of dipping sauces (thai peanut, curry ketchup, etc). There were also mustard squirt bottles on the table for the sausages. For me, the experience was enjoyable because I was having a good night in general.

Anyways, when a group of my friends chose this random hotdog place ... I was NOT excited. Even worse, they could NOT tell me the name of the place... they butchered it every possible way. During the drive to Wurstkuche... I had extremely low, bottom of the barrel expectations of this place. The place is located in the arts district of downtown LA so it's a pretty hipster joint. The staff working there was super laid-back and there wasn't much of a line (at least when I went). I spent some time reading through the different sausages they had and it was all pretty interesting. The sausages range from classics ($5.75), gourmet ($6.50), to exotic ($7.50).  The exotic ones were toOOoo exotic for my liking... buffalo? alligator? rattlesnake? rabbit? All I could think was... ewwwwWww and wWHHAAAAaaa so I ended up ordering the chicken apple & spices with caramelized onions (a super safe choice and something I would recommend to first-timers) and belgian fries with sundried tomato mayo. Seating wasn't too bad, but I can imagine how irritating it could be if there was a long wait. Music was loud, lights were dim, and there were tons of people talking. I left Wurstkuche satisfied with the food and the experience as a whole. I recommend this place to everyone and anyone... hotdog lovers and haters alike!"},{"date":"2014-08-17","rating":"2.0","review":"Although the customer service was really good, the vegetarian chipotle was nothing special.

The selection of sausages are fantastic and appeal to non-risk-takers (yawn) to those who are game for things like rattlesnake, rabbit and other random creatures.  I didn't love that my sausage was cooked until it was almost the consistency of jerky.  I thought my rabbit was dead when I ordered it, but apparently it IS possible to kill an animal even more.  I was looking forward to the fresh baked bun, only to be disappointed to find the sausage-to-bread ratio way off.  There were times my rabbit went missing and I had to tear off the bread to get to it, there was that much bread. The fries were also a downer.  They were way too crispy (more like quadrupel dipped) but most importantly, they just didn't taste that good. They get points for the Belgian-style presentation in a paper cone and fancy dipping sauces.  But that's it. As far as the beer selection goes, JP was pleased with the draft and bottled offerings.  Location is in a seedy part of downtown and parking is on the street. The atmosphere is very chill once you're inside and it has  a cool and funky industrial feel. Great late night hours. Overall, we were not impressed with the food and for how much we paid, I don't see myself going back anytime soon.  Who knows, maybe we ordered wrong... But here it goes:What we ordered:Buffalo and chipotle sausage (great flavor, but dry) $7.50Rabbit, veal, pork sausage $7.50Belgian Fries $3-5Tips:Bring Mace.  The neighborhood isn't exactly where I'd like to be when the sun goes down. For first timers, the restaurant's setup may be a little intimidating or confusing. Upon entry, there is a cold meat case right when you walk in.  Patrons select their choice of sausage and 2 toppings.  After you place your food and drink order at the front register, you pay and you're given a number.  There's a dining room attached to the store front where seating is first come first serve.  But don't worry, it's pretty spacious. Once your food is up, it's delivered to your table."},{"date":"2014-12-22","rating":"4.0","review":"You have to be a sausage lover and I am not particulary but the sausge and fires were great!

However, exotic hotdogs are all I order whenever I go back. Actually to be honest, you can't really taste everything anyway, although there is a distinct different between textures. My favorites are Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Pepppers, Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned with White Wine & my BF loves the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers! You can also pick 2 topping on every hotdogs (or more if you want) & my favorites are caramelized onions & sauerkraut!Beer - their beer menu is great! My favorite is actually floris apple which is more of a apple-flavored soda that is very over-priced, but I LOVE it! You can also order more alcohol in the back bar instead of waiting in the line all over again which I find very convenient.Fries - With or without truffles, they are good! Fluffy potatoes with dipping sauce, as well as other condiments on the house (they have many verities of mustard!) is always interesting! My favorite dipping sauce is blue cheese, walnut and bacon, which is thick & heavy but mmm so good!After you order, you walk down a long hallway to the main dining room that has long picnic table with benches white you share with others or few private tables all which you are to grab as soon as they are available. Although it is first-come-first-serve seating, I find it much more civil than other places & I always manage to find tables. I do like the hip, industrial-like atmosphere of the back dining room, as the wooden tables & benches go really well with the brick wall! True, you won't have personal space & it is super loud, but it's fun! You can also draw on the table with markers which brings out your inner childhood memories. There is also a live DJ at night time which makes the whole hotdog with beer experience more exciting!"},{"date":"2014-11-02","rating":"5.0","review":"Amazing bratwurst!!

Flash forward and JEEZ! Parking is horrible now and even more so with the parking thing that's across the street (btw they charge you $10 bucks to park there even though the signs says $2 every 10-15 minutes or something) - I'm not paying $10 extra for a 8$ dog!Moving onto the actual place itself:It's awesome! It has this cool O.G. downtown feel to the building and there's always people talking in there and all sorts of different walks of life coming and going.The food is great and has been consistent through all the time I've been coming here.Almost the entire menu has now gone through my digestive tract, and I will say that the Duck and Bacon with caramelized onions and spicy peppers is my favorite from there, with the Louisiana hot link, crocodile, and Austin blues as runner ups.The fries are almost always great, although since they are fried twice in duck oil, sometimes you get the bottom bits which are BURNT like a mofo and taste rancid! Otherwise they have a nice crunchy crust, and fluffy interior which pairs awesome with their chipotle aioli dipping sauce.Beer... beer BEER! There's a ton of Belgian-style beers on draft and bottle in here. IF you are into that style you will be pleased for their extensive selection, AND they use the appropriate glassware for every beer (except one time I got the wrong glass... maybe the bar tender had a few himself?) I'm not a big fan of Belgian stuff, but I still manage to find the weihenstephaner dunkelweizen and Celebrator doppelbock pretty damn tasty, but for like $8-10 dollars per beer (most styles) and no happy hour it can get a bit steep. All in all, I love this place. I would of given it a perfect 5 star if they had more California style IPA/true Stouts (this is a German themed bar after all), and a happy hour. Some people complain about the area being ghetto/scary and whatnot, but I've been coming here super late and walk from all the other bars and across the streets here and nothings has ever happened.

We waited in line 45 minutes on a Thursday night to place are order. There a slight reward is your position in line moves from outdoors to indoors as on that threshold you're allowed to order and enjoy a beer. Come with friends to enjoy your time in line.You CAN skip the line for sausages and other food and head directly into the bar or outdoor patio if you're simply drinking. Another tactic to deal with the line for famed sausages is to send the bulk of your group into the bar and rely on 2 volunteers to wait out the line for sausages.IMHO the DJ needs to pump down the volume to promote conversations amongst friends seated at thee table.Yes, with all those airings of grievances Wirstkuche comes through with a five star rating.The reason is you am not easily find their gourmet or exotic sausages elsewhere. My family enjoyed the following:* Alligator and Andouille* Rabbit and Rattlesnake with jalapeño* Duck and baconAll excellent and exotic. My favorite was the Rabbit and Rattlesnake.Erin called the fries the best she's everhad. Amply wedged from potatoes and twice fries - be sure to select most tempting dipping sauces when you order.The beer list of Belgium and German draught and bottled beers numbers in the dozens."},{"date":"2013-06-23","rating":"5.0","review":"Wurstkuche is no normal place to get classic German sausages. Skip the temptation and go for the gold: exotics. This is one place where trying rattlesnake, crocodile, and rabbit wont get you regretting it. You may get funny reactions from your mother who heard you tried it (she asked if I was eating animals at the zoo--silly mom), but it's definitely an adventure worth taking. Food: - Rattlesnake & Rabbit ($8): Definitely dont taste the rattlesnake or rabbit, but you know in your mind that it's in there...somewhere. This was actually a fantastic choice. The sausage is plump and juicy with a mixture of jalapeno peppers which gives it a light and buttery feel with the whole dog. It was the best out of the ones we tried. Definitely recommended if you want to really spook your brain but realize it's not bad at all.  - Crocodile & Pork ($8): This sausage is a bit longer in length from the others, but honestly it's a bit drier. The thicker casing gives it a nice resistance to each bite, but it also doesnt make it as juicy since the dog itself was missing some flavors you would hope to have. Like the other exotics, you cant taste anything funky. I probably wont get this again because of the lack of intriguing texture and flavor that I was hoping for. - Austin Blues ($6.5): We chose this because my brother and I were from Austin, so I guess it kind of worked well. I loved the smokey taste to the dog that encapsulated the pork that it was made of. The slight spiciness was not that distinct, but it did bring a hot texture that made it enjoyable. Flavors were flowing and definitely not dry. It was great but not a top choice for me. It was, for a lack of better words, safe. - Fries with Truffle Oil: Honestly if you havent tried their normal fries, there's nothing to compare this with. It did have a slight hint of the oil but honestly it wasnt anything in specific. They were large-cut fries with a generous flow of cooking oil. Nothing impressive but it did go very well with the dogs.Pros: - Gastropub feel and noise level. Definitely gives that kind of ambiance - Clean and efficient service even though it takes a while to get through the line! - Location is in a bit of a hipster-progressive neighborhood. You can totally feel it.Cons: - A little bit expensive for my taste. $8 for a dog is not my ideal price range, but it was great for what it was. - The lines can be insanely long. like looping around outside. Be careful. I suggest calling before you head over (which really did help) - Parking is tricky since there's no designated parking spot. Finding a spot on the street may be a little tricky.The nonadventurous side of me had its quota-fill for the month. No more crazy foods for a little while, but definitely it was an experience worth documenting.

Vraiting reviews dat ich. I cahn nevuh figure out vai I ahlways put zem off, but for dis place...dis place icht gut. I vrait da review vraight a vay! To quote mein friend, zees sausages \"quite frankly, brät us pure joy.\" Now before we get into a swordfight over which sausage brät it's a-game to my mouth, I *must* disclaim that I will be updating this review every time I visit. It's obvious this guy can handle only so much of a sausagefest before tapping out, so I'll be going to take them on, one at a time. I'm not leaving LA anytime soon and we all know Wurstküche AINT never going out of bitness anytime soon, neithers!Upon my first visit to Wurstküche, I was overWelmed by the sheer variety they offer. It was a meat market in there! I'm surprised they didn't have someone working the mop and bucket, cleaning up everyone's drool. Yes there is a line. Don't be a dick and cut! Wait your turn and you will be rewarded with glorious meat tubes. The cashier and the beer lady were extremely pleasant and I like that about places like this. There are no pretentious asswipes here. Even the runner/buss boy gave a me wink when he handed us our food! Hay! Good tip for all of y'all! Although everyone fawns over the Rattlesnake, Rabbit, and chipotle link, I wasn't going to bend over backwards to get it...I was going to let my instinct decide what I was going to have...in general, I need to let my gut decide what it wants me to do every time. It has never been wrong and I need to believe in it more and you do too! Stop being a wiener and believe in yourself...it'll do you some good. Anyway, it decided that pheasant and herbs de provence was what it wanted...topped with caramelized onions and sweet peppers no less. WHOOOOO-WEEEEE! Am I a phucking phan oph the pheasant dog.I bit that brät and honest to God, it bit me back with an explosion of flavor. This tubesteak was absolutely the best cylindrical item i've tasted to date. Fennel and thyme are superb herbs and compliment pheasant meat (which is similar to chicken and possibly turkey). It also paired VERY WELL with my Reissdorf Kölsch draught. Light. Crisp. Excellent with any of the other \"white meat\" sausages. (My friend and I pointed out the veal sausage and how it was like the albino brät. It just stood out among the rest with its pale (lack of) color. o__o) In addition, my friend and I split a \"Groot\" cone of the twice fried Belgian Frites and two dipping sauces...the Chipotle aïoli and the BBQ. Both are amazing..In fact, I would even suggest ordering an extra of the BBQ to go with the Austin Blues brät. These fries were down right delicious and worth every sinful calorie. I don't care what you say, these are MANDATORY.Sigh, until we meet again Wurstküche...I will be dreaming of your meatpoles...every...day...and...night."},{"date":"2014-08-19","rating":"2.0","review":"Overpriced hipster hangout.  The sort of place where young, materialistic hipsters flock to so they can flash their money around and impress their friends.  The sausages were good but not worth the highfalutin prices.  The selection of beers is the best thing going about this place, but beer is also overpriced here.  There was a lot of douche bagness going on in the joint, too.  I hadn't heard as many cheesy pickup lines from guys I'd never go out with even if they paid me since my freshman year."},{"date":"2010-08-16","rating":"4.0","review":"This place is a nice place to go for your sausage and beer fix. The atmosphere is great and friendly and the food is pretty good.When we went inside, we basically ordered what we wanted at the front cashier. Then we took our sign to the back of the restaurant and sat down in those long long tables. So in a way, it's not like, you sit down and wait for your waiter to take your order.... it's more like fast food etiquette but classier. The restaurant itself was pretty modern and hip, and I liked the idea of the long tables. It seemed like a nice place to talk with people sitting nearby you. Also there are small tables, but those are very limited and most likely already been taken, and there is also a nice bar. You also can get your ice cold water, self serve... and also pick up your utensils and napkins next to the water jug.The food... I got a Louisiana hot link with carmelized onions and sweet peppers. Also got belgian fries with pesto mayo, and I also got a Fruili Beer (beer fermented with strawberries). Overall the food was really good. I was more surprised on how good my pesto mayo tasted... that was bomb. Also the sausage was really well made as well as the belgian fries. The fruili beer was good... but $8 for such a little amount... uhh....Overall, my experience was pretty good and I will definitely come here again."},{"date":"2012-10-25","rating":"4.0","review":"Good hot dogs.

Seating is not assigned.  They have adopted the \"go to a bench and eat\" mentality like at Oktoberfest or lunchtime in grade school.  When it's busy, this can be troublesome.  I suggest sending a friend to find a table while you wait in line if the place is pretty happening. Your sausage is served with the choice of two of the four options:Caramelized Onions: They are good.  I ask them to go light on the onions as they can be a bit overbearing.Sauerkraut: Bring it!  I love this stuff.  How can you not have sauerkraut on your bratwurst?Sweet Peppers: not a fanSpicy Peppers: not a fan, but better than the sweet peppersTheir gourmet mustards are also great: Whole Grain, Spicy Brown, Honey Mustard, and American Yellow.Bratwurst: fine cuts of pork, coriander and nutmeg.  Really good.Filipino Marharlika: sweet prok, natural seasonings.  When I read this I was thinking longanisa, but it's not.  But still really good.Rabbit, veal and pork seasoned with white wine:  like the description, it's light and delicate.  They forgot to mention DELICIOUS!Their Fries are good too.  It's really good with their buttermilk ranch.  I don't really care for their other sauces especially their ketchups, but the tzatzik is new and looks enticing.If you want to try the a German Pilsner: Spaten is light and is really good with bratwurst.Enjoy!"},{"date":"2014-10-08","rating":"5.0","review":"I nnneeeed to go back to this place it is so f-ing delicious!

Once you've managed to find parking, have located the correct entrance, navigated yourself to the back of the line, and sent a scout ahead to the dining room to stake out your spot (seriously, do all these things), it's difficult to make a bad choice.Of their many sausages, I've tried several:Bratwurst: Sweet, mild, subtly spicy, and very user-friendly.Hot Italian: Snappy casing, hot and juicy, everything Johnsonville would want it to be.Austin Blues: Perfect southern smoked pork sausage, with just enough heat. I actually don't think it's as spicy as the Italian, but I've never had them at the same time.Marharlika: Such a lovely combination of super-sweet pork, mild spices, super-juiciness. Almost like a high-quality Lil' Smokie. Delightful.Alligator Andouille: Good flavor, but pretty dry and crumbly and a very thick casing. Definitely get with toppings or some sort of accompanying condiment or sauce.Duck and Bacon: I didn't know what to expect with this one, but it was also slightly crumbly in texture. Relatively mild in flavor, I don't think I would have identified either duck or bacon, but it was still quite good.All of their sausages are grilled to perfection and placed lovingly upon a likewise grilled, soft bun that will both yield willingly to your teeth and hold all that shit together. I don't personally get toppings, but they offer grilled peppers, onions, and kraut. In the dining room are bottles of ketchup and all four of the major mustard groups (yellow, dijon, whole grain, something else -- mustard is not my condiment). I also encourage you to experiment with their many sauce offerings such as curry ketchup and blue cheese bacon walnut.I also hope you're a fries person, and even if you are not (and I'm actually not!), you have to try them. These are the best fries in LA -- thick-cut, perfectly fried, slightly crispy, tender, and not too greasy. You can easily share small fries between two people, so I recommend doing so and trying as many sauces as possible alongside.Lastly, if you're into beer, Wurstküche offers a stunning selection of German and Belgian beers both on tap and in bottles, including La Chouffe, Blanche de Bruxelles, and pints (!) of Spaten.Before Wurstküche, I wasn't really the sort of person who would recommend going to a restaurant that exclusively serves sausage, fries and beer. Now, I can't really imagine the Arts District, or my life, without it."},{"date":"2014-11-08","rating":"5.0","review":"Well... Where to start? Beer? Juicy sausages? Double fried fries?

I had it with spicy peppers, dijon mustard, and onions.I was definitely loving my sausage, I did like the fact that you can order your drink in line (I seemed to notice everyone else doing so), one thing I wasn't such a fan of was that maybe I wasn't like a local looking type of person or not \"hipster\" enough, but the guy who greets and passes out menus was just not friendly with me. Literally offered everyone something to drink except for me, didn't give me a menu until 5 minutes I was already waiting in line, and pretended like he didn't see me. I won't complain about the wait because it was worth it, it is very delicious, but they do need to work on their social skills. Also the guy at the register was a bit of a snob, maybe he was just trying to rush through because there was plenty of people waiting, but anywhere I go I really just want to be treated decently as a customer. Which is such a shame, because I specifically looked up for this place on yelp before going in, I went in with the expectation of giving this place 5 stars, I won't give this place less then 3 because the food is delicious, they have a decent size menu of beer and sausages, which is awesome.

I really liked the food, it was very flavorful! The parking situation is a little difficult, there is no parking lot so you will have to learn to parallel park if you don't know how to already.

It's got a super industrial vibe to it, with its wooden beams and concrete floor, which makes it all the more cool/special to check out.Anyway.. ON TO THE FOOD!The Rattlesnake/Rabbit/Jalapeno sausage is sooo delicious. It's got that bite that gives way to a juicy, flavorful and only mildly spicy sausage, despite the jalapenos. I totally forgot that there were such exotic ingredients in it because all I could think about was how awesome it tasted.The smoky flavor of the sausage + slightly sweet, toasty bun + ALL THE MUSTARDS = I need to come here again.  I also tried my friend's Kielbasa which was pretty standard but still great, and my other friend's crocodile sausage, which was oddly chewy because the casing was kinda thick. I don't think I'd get it, and I don't think she would again either lol. AND THE FRIES. OH MY GOODNESS, you must try the fries. They're thick cut, and oily, and crispy, and piping hot, and probably the best fries of my life. Seriously, and the chipotle aioli is my favorite. Oh, and speaking of mustard, love how this place has 5 different kinds! I'm quite the fan of mustard. Spicy Brown, Dijon, American Yellow, Whole Grain, and Honey Mustard. You can hoard them at your table and make every bite a different experience. PARKINGHewitt has 4 hour and 10 hour parking, but meters stop running at 6pm.

For starters, I've seen first timers walking through the large double doors at the corner of 3rd and Traction. Sure, there's no sign that says \"Wurstkuche\" and you're probably thinking \"maybe it's one of those trendy restaurant that has a sign-less restaurant\" or \"it's probably a hole-in-the-wall, they don't need to stinking sign\". Nope, those double doors are actually the exit.The actual entrance is actually on Traction Ave (right across from Pie Hole). Once you're there, you line up and order your food. If you're totally new, the server will guide you what to get. The food ranges from \"normal\"  to \"fancy foodie gourmet\" to \"hell, I wanna live life and eat a rattlesnake and a rabbit once in my life\". Yes, there's a rattlesnake and rabbit sausage on the menu. Don't be afraid to try it.Once you order your food or drink (they give it to you on the spot), go down a long and dark hallway and out into a big grand dark room with loud music. If you wanna smoke & eat, there's a door before the large room that takes you to outside. This is a cafeteria-style seating so it's free-for-all. Don't worry, it's not like high-school; people are friendly here so don't be afraid. But, if you're feeling anti-social, wanna be alone with your date, or dislike 'hipsters' for whatever reason, you can try the tables by the wall or the seats in the dark corner.If you didn't order alcohol or their bottles fruit juices, you can get some free water near the exit (along with napkins, forks, and plates). Condiments should already be on the table.I ordered the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno sausage and it's okay... if anything, it taste pretty lean but I guess that's why they added jalapeno. My gf ordered buffalo, beef & pork sausage which I liked more.Their Belgin Fries, however are BOMB! Though, it's a tad bit salty and some were a little little burnt but that's okay, I'm a carb junkie and I freakin' LOVE fries. I highly recommend on their large order of fries (called Groot) since it comes with 2 free dipping sauces. So far, my favorite is pesto mayo but need to come back again and try them all.Overall, I would come back again to this place. The food and drinks here is delicious and service is nice. It seems a bit intimating but if you're feeling adventurous and wanna try something totally, Wurstkuche is a good place to try."},{"date":"2014-01-27","rating":"4.0","review":"Second time I've been and I haven't been disappointed yet!!The first time I came on a Friday around 7pm- WORST TIME EVER. The line was about an hour long and we could barely find a place to sit down. I got the kielbasa with small regular fries and chipotle aioli sauce. The kielbasa was tasty, but nothing to write home about. The fries were great and the chipotle aioli was surprisingly my favorite part of the meal.The second time I went was on a Sunday around 7pm- definitely not as crowded! There were only a few people in line and this super nice girl kept asking us if we needed drinks or anything. I ordered the Rattlesnake and Rabbit this time around with the small fries and chipotle aioli (because it's seriously the best dipping sauce they have). My friend got the Buffalo one and he said it was the best thing he's ever tasted. The Rattlesnake was buttery like the menu said, but not spicy like they suggested. I'd say add the spicy peppers instead of sweet peppers if you go with that one. We were able to find seating pretty easily, but were still a bit cramped until later in the evening around 8:30 when the main crowd left.Overall:Food is AWESOME. But order something different like the Mango jalapeno, rattlesnake, or buffalo sausage because that's really what makes Wurstkuche stand out. The truffle fries aren't really worth it, they don't taste too much different than the regular fries. Get the chipotle aioli sauce! It's deliciousAtmosphere is okay. A little too loud for my taste and it's super dark. They could do better with the music. Since when is a guy with a laptop a \"DJ\"?Seating is the only reason why I gave them four stars instead of five. You're crammed together on communal benches for the most part and sometimes you get a few idiots that sit in the very middle and make larger parties have to cram in like sardines. Even though they have bench seating, it's really difficult for large groups to find somewhere to sit, just a heads up."},{"date":"2013-08-08","rating":"5.0","review":"No better combination than beers and Bratwurst...except Duck & Bacon sausage with Jalapeno Peppers or Rabbit, Veal, and Pork white wine sausage....Welcome to a sausage casing haven!!Its a restaurant based on the usual chicken, pork, turkey, and OH YEAH, exotic meats stuffed into gourmet sausages---im talking crocodile, rattlesnake, pheasant, buffalo, and other specialities.

We got caramelized onions on both hot dogs, but sweet peppers on the alligator & pork and sauerkraut on the rattlesnake & rabbit. Both hot dogs were delicious! The alligator & pork was slightly milder with a more herb-like flavor, whereas the rattlesnake & rabbit had some more kick to it because of the jalapeno peppers. Although I'm not a huge fan of tons of sauerkraut, I will say that I was surprised how well the sauerkraut complemented the spicy, salty sausage. Even the bread of the hot dog buns was different from your typical Costco hot dog buns. I think the bread could be improved, perhaps softer and less dry, with slightly toasted edges, but overall I loved both hot dogs. Service Review: Unlike the last time I was here, there was a young lady passing out menus, explaining drink options, and telling us what the essential decisions we needed to make by the time we got to the register (2 toppings + 1 fries dressing). Definitely streamlined the process! Venue Review: The venue hasn't changed since my last visit: still long tables, dispersed smaller tables at the edges of the dining room, bar to the back, and self-serve water and utensils at the end of the bar. Although parking is mostly street, since a friend dropped us off we didn't have any issues. Overall Impression: If you're looking for a quality hot dog experience (as much of an oxymoron as it sounds), this is the first place that comes to my mind. The variety of crazy meats (e.g., rattlesnake!!) definitely bump this little establishment up to 5-stars in my book.

You wait on line to order, take your number and then go sit in their huge cafeteria style dining area.The line when we got there was outside (which isn't too hard since it's a rather small entrance), and we waited about 10 minutes to order our meals. They have a TON of options, even ones for vegetarians. I tried the mexican chipotle and mango jalapeño and they were so tasty! The combo of spicy with toppings (caramelized onions and sweet peppers) and different mustards was like an explosion of awesome in your mouth. The bun was perfect. We all shared fries with pesto mayo and curry ketchup for dipping and WHOA, the fries were SO delicious. Anyone who goes here needs to get fries with their meal; they're so crunchy and soft at the same time.This place really hit a home run for these two reason: (1) we had about 11 in our group and considering it's cafeteria style, it's hard to find a large enough bench area to fit so many people. One of the employees very nicely helped us find an area that accommodated us all, something he really didn't have to do! (2) Birthday cake! My friend had baked a birthday cake to have after our meal, and another employee was so nice to us going and getting us plates for our cake when we didn't even ask (we were just going to eat it off the paper on the table....).

Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers- topped with caramelized onions & sauerkraut.  The bun was toastey and just right. It was definitely delicious especially when you smother your hot dog with all the different condiments that are available at your booth/table.  Of course, I drizzled mine with honey mustard :)2. Chicken Apple- standard but juice nonetheless from the one bite I took.2. Belgium Fries- opted for the white truffle drizzle with the choices of pesto mayo and sun dried tomato mayo dipping sauces.  Can I say these fries were BOMB?!?! You have to order a side of these fries when you come here.  The dipping sauces compliment the fries so well with so much flavor that I couldn't stop feeding my mouth!2 drinks- Lemonade and Mandarin Orange Sparkling Juice.  They don't have your typical drinks here so beware.  Most people order the beers but I wasn't in the mood for beer during my first meal of the dayTotal: around $30. pretty darn pricey for a hot dog meal but it was so worth it :)Must check it out if you are a hot dog lover like me :)"},{"date":"2014-07-15","rating":"4.0","review":"Great vibes, I can't speak for the sausages but the fries and aioli are amazing!"},{"date":"2013-08-26","rating":"4.0","review":"The whole pretentious hipster vibe is a bit off-putting, but the dogs are good.

You get to pick two out of four toppings (caramelized onions, sweet pepper, spicy pepper, or sauerkraut). Then there are like 20+ different kinds of sausages. I went with the Austin Blues - hot and spicy, tri-pepper and hardwood smoked pork. I also had the Klein (small) fries with  blue cheese-walnut-bacon dipping sauce. There are like 10+ different dipping sauces for your fries. Like the combinations are limitless!The Austin Blues had just the right amount of heat to it and a nice bbq smoke infused flavor. Also very juicy. I should have gotten sauerkraut and spicy peppers instead because the sweet pepper and spicy pepper together had a strange bitter taste to me. The blue cheese walnut bacon sauce was really yummy. The blue cheese was creamy and the you can never go wrong with bacon. Only thing is that it is a thicker sauce than the chipotle aioli or sundried tomato so it was harder to dip the fries in. The fries were actually a bit too salty for me. The front of the store is like a closet, but once you walk down the brick hallway to the back it's like a chic basement hub with picnic long tables. Everything was very vibrant and the music was upbeat. The waitress/waiters were unbelievably friendly. They check in on you like every 10 minutes. Plus the main waiter in the front passing out the menu to everyone in line was uber cute!Parking is a pain since it does not have it's own lot, but TOTALLY worth it! I must now come back to try the mango jalapeno sausage and santa fe jack cheese and jalapeno peppers. $10 total is kind of expensive for but it is the gourmet \"hot dog.\""},{"date":"2013-10-11","rating":"5.0","review":"Not a big fan of hot dogs but this place was pretty delicious & packed! I ordered chicken & apple spices...not sure. Just know it was yummy. I was skeptical on the fries when i saw pictures. Thought they'd be burnt, but i was WRONG!! They're very good & the dips are a must to go along with them.  I'd definitely come back! Especially for some beer tasting. The variety of drinks (alcoholic & non-alcoholic) amazes me!

After a long morning of hunting down dresses at Fashion District, my friends and I stopped by Wurstkuche around 1:30. We parked on the street and walked the remaining distance to the line that had extended out the doors. We were given menus so that it'd be faster for us to order once inside. Less than 20 minutes later, the bunch and I ordered. The cashier was super friendly and to my surprise, they broke my Benjamin without hesitation. Bonus! We were also able to find a table but we were quick to notice that it was a full house on a Saturday afternoon.Once we were seated, our food came out in less than 10 minutes. I had ordered a mango jalapeno with caramelized onions and kraut while my friends ordered a hot italian and filipino maharlika. My male friend finished his dog way faster than my other friend and I - it was that freaking delicious. We also ordered the small belgian fries with chipotle aioli and it was more than the 3 of us could finish. You really do get more bang for your buck here but be sure to come with an empty stomach and full wallet. Prices here are a bit on the high side and an individual can quickly rack up $10 just for lunch alone but the servings are huge. I'll definitely be back to try the more exotic dogs and friendly customer service!"},{"date":"2012-06-29","rating":"4.0","review":"Food is good, though a little pricey when you add everything up (in my opinion). I've been fortunate where my max wait time was probably 15 minutes. There's a single line that usually goes out the door (I used to see a long line when driving by). After ordering in the front, you move on with your drink and order# down a long hallway to the back where the seating is. There are rows of long tables and you're on your own to find a seat. It's been pretty crowded and loud when I've been so we've just gone outside to eat. Guess I really am getting old... Anyhow, if you want another beer, you don't have to get back into the long line, there's a bar in the seating area and a DJ spinning some loud music.We've tried most of the exotic sausages and some of the others as well. They're all quite good so you're pretty much safe with whatever you choose.Parking can be a b--ch... It's street parking. I'm familiar with the area since I go to Little Tokyo often for sushi so I know where to look. There may be valet but I'm not sure if you need to do that since it's along a quiet street so it's not stressful at all roaming the streets for parking. Driving around, you're bound to find something. Overall, good food and vibe. I don't think it's too pretentious and wanna-be cool (with bad service) like some gastro-pubs out there. I would go back."},{"date":"2012-06-08","rating":"3.0","review":"Exotic sausages? What the!? Being an adventurous diner, I love to try exotic foods (especially when traveling overseas), so had to check this place out that sells sausages made of rattlesnake, rabbit, buffalo, or alligator. I've tried rabbit and snake before but never alligator or buffalo. The process:1. You pick a sausage: I ordered a RATTLESNAKE AND RABBIT WITH JALAPENO PEPPERS SAUSAGE.2. You pick 2 toppings out of Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers, Spicy Peppers. I chose CARAMELIZED ONIONS AND SWEET PEPPERS (the peppers I asked to be on the side). 3. A drink (optional). Beers are the most common because what goes better with a sausage dog? I chose plain water though because I'm not used to beers just yet.4. Your choice of mustards/toppings, which are located in the dining area (Whole Grain, Dijon, Spicy Brown,Honey Mustard, American Yellow, Ketchup). I loaded mine up with HONEY MUSTARD sauce because I'm a big fan of honey mustard and a little bit of ketchup.The overall size of the sausages were like a huge Oscar Meyer weiner (it wasn't puny but it was enormous either). Definitely not like the size of sausages you can get at the OC or LA County Fair. I really wished it were a bit bigger because I wasn't quite full when I finished (maybe next time I would order a side of fries). I ate half of my RATTLESNAKE AND RABBIT WITH JALAPENO PEPPERS SAUSAGE and ate half of my sister's BUFFALO, BEEF, AND PORK WITH CHIPOTLE PEPPERS. The RATTLESNAKE AND RABBIT was indeed buttery like the description said. You could really taste the butter, which made the sausage moist and not dry. The grilled onions were grilled to perfection and the sweet onions were also a great addition to the sausage. And since it had a bit of jalapeno peppers to it, it added a small kick of spiciness (a perfect amount because I can't handle really spicy foods). The honey mustard I splashed on gave my sausage a sweet taste, which I liked (my sister didn't like the honey mustard). My sister's BUFFALO, BEEF, AND PORK sausage had more of a meaty flavor to it. She also had the same toppings as I did (grilled onions and sweet peppers), but instead of honey mustard, she put regular mustard and ketchup. Overall, since it was more meaty, considering it had buffalo, beef, and pork, it was a little bit tougher as well. The atmosphere was very social. It's a great place to chill with friends and have a couple of beers and sausages. But don't go too often unless you can afford it though because it is quite expensive. My sausage alone (with no drinks or sides) came out to be at most $9.00 (each exotic sausage is $7.50). So if you're planning on having beers and a side, it's going to be quite an expensive meal for what you get.But in the end, it's a good place to check out once in a while, especially if you've never eaten exotic foods and would like to gradually work your way up to more daring culinary adventures."},{"date":"2014-07-13","rating":"4.0","review":"So many delicious beers!!  The line was out the door, but definitely worth the wait!   These people have this business down.  They handed us menus well before we reached the cashier so we could hem and haw over everything and settle on a choice before we got to the front.  They also serve you beer once you enter the building so you can sip while your in line.  From the menu you choose two toppings from a list (caramelized onions, sweet peppers, hot peppers or sauerkraut), it lists the mustard that they offer, but those are self serve on the tables, and then you choose from their extensive list of sausage types.  They also offer delicious fries.  Small you get to choose one dip and large you get two dips.  Additional dips can be purchased for an additional 75 cents.  Got the Rattlesnake and rabbit (sad to find out that they used to offer an alligator and a pheasant, but that is no longer the case) topped with caramelized onions and the hot peppers. Also ordered a large fries with the blue cheese, bacon and walnut and the curry ketchup.  The sausage was wonderful!  So much flavor, not overly salty.  Onions needed longer on heat to be real caramelized onions, but they were still tasty.  Didn't really get any heat from the hot peppers or the jalapenos that were added to the sausage mix.  The fries were fantastic.  The blue cheese dip was absolutely delicious and so was the curry ketchup.  I found myself dipping the fry in the curry ketchup and then in their honey mustard and the flavor combination was awesome..When we got to the seating area, this place is a total hipster scene and their music selection was offal.  Very hard to carry on a conversation with someone when you're  forced to eat with blaring music (hence minus one star).  They have a permanent DJ station in the eating area, just an idea of the kind of crowd and atmosphere this place strive to retain.  I wish I wasn't subjected to having to listen to the \"music\" selection, but it did make us finish our food quickly so we could escape the scene.  Overall very delicious food, service was outstanding, the atmosphere was totally not my cup of tea.  Will order togo next time."},{"date":"2014-09-13","rating":"5.0","review":"They serve beer in a boot and you get to eat off the tables.

You bust out your iPhone and the first bookmark you see is Wurstküche. You make your way over, but you realize you're surrounded by artsy fartsy hipsters. Can you still eat here? Hell yesThe line is usually about a 15-20 min wait spanning out the door, but you can look at the menu while you're waiting. With such a diverse selection of sausages, it's time very well spent. My eyes directly floated down to the \"Exotics\" section, which includes some of favorite meat: buffalo, rabbit, alligator, and rattlesnake. I ended up getting the Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned with White Wine sausage with grilled onions on top. This was one of the most exquisite and delectable sausages I've ever had. Cooked just right and not charred at all, packed with meaty goodness, and fairly light as well. The bun wasn't too thick and provided just the right amount of support for the sausage. A meal here isn't complete without a side of Belgian fries. A large order is more than enough to share between two people, and you get two sauces as well. The Pesto Mayo and Blue Cheese Walnut & Bacon were amazing for dipping, with the Pesto Mayo definitely coming out on top between the two. If all that wasn't enough, they have 5 different condiments available: Dijon Mustard, Whole Grain Mustard, American Yellow Mustard, Honey Mustard, and Ketchup. In my opinion, Honey Mustard goes the best with any sausage, but to each his own. The drinks menu is highly extensive, with some of the highest quality German and Belgian beers on tap. For $8 a pint in the middle of the day, I wasn't really feeling it. If you must, though, Spaten Optimator would go perfectly with any sausage they serve.Wurstküche is was of my oldest \"To Try\" Yelp bookmarks, and once I finally got the chance to try it, it was worth every penny.

Not sure you can actually taste the differences in the meats, but there's quail rabbit, snake, chicken and at least three different veggie options."},{"date":"2012-07-30","rating":"3.0","review":"Hmm..I'm not really sure what all the fuss is about? About $6-8 for a hot dog and $4-5 for french fries. I went with a group of 10 and all of us felt that the hot dogs were a-ok, my kielbasa was quite salty and my stomach hurt the rest of the night. The french fries were better than the hot dogs since they were fried twice and extra fatty :) The seating area can get cramped, especially during the weekend evenings, and the DJ music was so loud none of us could hear each other."},{"date":"2013-10-24","rating":"4.0","review":"I never know what to order when I come here.  I don't know if I should be daring and try something crazy like the rattlesnack or stay safe with an animal I've eaten before.  I normally stay safe unfortunately.  I can't remember what I got the first time I went but most recently I got the Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers.  It was delicious.They have a great beer selection.  This is the place where I discovered Belgian Floris Apple.  DELICIOUS!  I love that stuff and always get it when I go.  Definitely pricey but tastes great will you're standing in line waiting to order.  I love that they have someone going around taking drink orders while you wait in line.I really like the atmosphere here.  It's very casual and laid back, great place to hang out with friends."},{"date":"2014-02-24","rating":"5.0","review":"They've got an amazing array of beers on tap, but if you're looking for typical American stuff this is not your place.  It's got a nice, simple and clean look to it.  The bartender was super friendly, and let us sample a few beers to see if we'd like it before ordering a full pint.  They are traditional in the fact that they serve each beer in its respective glass, which I think is a nice touch that not too many places seem to do anymore.There are absolutely no TV's in here which I think is great, as some places bash you over the head with them, so not the place to be watching a sports game, be aware what you're getting yourself into.I haven't yet tried the food, but I've heard from others that it's great, I look forward to trying some on a future visit."},{"date":"2010-01-20","rating":"5.0","review":"They claim they have the best sausage in LA... and yet the name sounds like they're saying \"worst cooch\". I have to admit, as a gay man, I was conflicted. Could have gone either way on this one.I liked the vibe right away. It actually did remind me of my time in Germany, the gastropubs in Berlin and Hamburg. Same type of energy, same type of vibe. Kudos, Wurstküche... you're off to a good start.LOTS of choices, I didn't realize that sausages could be that versatile. (Pause for laughter that never comes): Bratwurst, Bockwurst, Hot Italian, Vegetarian Italian, Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sage, Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle,Mango Jalapeño, Chicken Apple & Spices, Austin Blues, Sun Dried Tomato & Mozzarella, Green Chillies & Cilantro,Filipino Marharlika, Kielbasa, Louisiana Hot Link...Then there's the exotics selection. I didn't have the nerve tonight, but sometime... Buffalo, Beef & Pork with Chipotle Peppers, Duck & Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers, Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned with White Wine, Alligator & Pork (you heard me), Smoked Andouille Sausage, and Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers (yikes).The place is a TOTAL sausagefest, and this is from someone who goes out in West Hollywood every weekend. Lots of beers too, all very Germanic. And great fries with many dipping sauces.Das ist der gutte scheisse!I can already tell this place will make me fat."},{"date":"2012-08-21","rating":"4.0","review":"Mission Impossible San Diego version:- Light ales (SD is infamous for their dark ales)- German food (SD has such a small pool... it's barely visible)- Currywurst (I love currywurst so much... it's what I pig out on when in Germany)So when I finally chanced this establishment on a Wednesday night (11 PM), I told my growling stomach to shush and waited in line (on a Wednesday!). I LOVE the expansive Belgian and German draft options. After gawking at the menu for a good 5 minutes, I settled on Blanche de Bruxelles then proceeded onto La Chouffe. Food: Duck & bacon wurst and truffle oil fries. I also ordered two orders of curry ketchup to complement my wurst (I just can't keep away)!The best part about my food was the curry ketchup. The duck & bacon was solid but nothing to amaze. I couldn't taste either the duck or the bacon but a smoky textured meat in lieu of... this could be a good quality except I love duck and bacon in its pure form so this transformation was a little disappointing. I might just order bratwurst with curry ketchup next time. The truffle oil fries: klein was plenty sufficient for two people, I think. Also, the fries are belgian-style (thick cut). If you are like me who prefers string fries, these are just a-ok but good enough to snack on.A great place to hang out with the munchies. :)"},{"date":"2013-07-16","rating":"4.0","review":"The line of hipsters out the front is entertaining. But it's great. Can't get past that awesome beer hall and the alfresco seating. The sausages are awesome and there's an awesome selection, plus the fact you can wash it down with a cold beer makes me very happy.

They have three types of sausages, standard, gourmet and exotic. I went with a standard sausage which seems odd to anyone who knows me as the exotic sausages seem more to my tasting. They also sell thick cut fries with various dipping sauces and all sorts of nonstandard sodas and beers. I ordered the bratwurst topped with grilled onions and sauerkraut and fries with the blue cheese walnut and bacon dipping sauce.  The sausage was good but my sandwich was topped with peppers rather then sauerkraut, but nothing for me to complain about.  I got a small order of fries which was way too much for myself. The dipping sauce was good but got to be too heavy after several dips.  The fries were good too but I prefer skinny fries.  I probably would've given this place a higher ratting if I didn't get a bacon wrapped hot dog from a street vender two days prior as that dog was delicious!  What is nice about this place are the huge community tables. This place is more of a hang out at night with friends with a good beer place.  The crowd seemed like it was mostly under 30 years old."},{"date":"2014-07-06","rating":"4.0","review":"Long lines usually signify good food...and this place always has long lines! So, I decided to check out the fuss and get my bratwurst on. I was impressed.Pros: since I love options, it was definitely a pro to have a two page long list of different sausages. They are broken down into different categories, from standard (veal, Italian, and many more), to gourmet (chicken/apple or Filipino-style), to exotic (alligator, buffalo, rattlesnake). I thought the Italian or the Mango Jalapeño were amazingly delicious. Additionally, I am a sucker for good fries. I commend Wurstkushe for not only having great sausages, but also superior fries. The fries are thickly cut, fresh, not over salted, and truly complement the sausage. These fries are one of the best I've every had. Ambience is a true representation of the arts district. You'll have to go to find out! Very nice decor, and full of brick (which I love). Great place to bring  a large group (or birthdays) because of the large tables inside (self seat). As far as beers - I'm not much of a beer person myself, but if you're into beers, they have a comprehensive selection of draft Belgian and German beers. My friends who are beer lovers can attest to the quality and options Wurstkushe provides.Cons: The sausages could be a little bit bigger. If you're hungry, you may want to order two. Otherwise, not many cons I can think of.Sum: great options, amazing fries. Get the Mango Jalapeño sausage! A true arts district classic restaurant that I'll be frequenting."},{"date":"2014-07-16","rating":"4.0","review":"I do love me some Sausage... and they got a great variety of sausage and beer.  very chill environment, I'm a fan! ,"},{"date":"2012-01-06","rating":"4.0","review":"PART 1:  An editorial...Please NAME THAT TUNE...We are the crowd, we're hungry and loudWant to eat your delights, just so that we can writeAnother glowing reviewAnd say that \"I went there, too.\"Leather and jeans, and shoes glamorousWe want to dress smart, because there's so many of usWe want to look good in line, And must look good when we dine...Banana Republic, Calvin KleinWe're your biggest fansThree thousand twenty views about theeLove Wurst, Love WurstkucheWe're Gen Next mod bourgeois Take 1200 pictures of yalike Papa-PAPARAZZIWe promise we'll be kindBut we won't stop checkin' in 'til mayor status is mineSo you can give us free hot dogs and truffle fries until I'm stuff-yLove Wurst Love WurstkuchePart 2:  Greg N's sincere, ironic, and hypocritical thoughts...in the same tuneI get the bacon and duck, with that I am stuckAnd mustard peppers supreme, gourmet fast food agleamWith diverse flavors aboundCan't eat this without making grunt soundsThe bock is so sour, I cannot devourThe healthy lemon flavors, it needs more fat to be savoredSundried tomato mayo, got me to \"ay-yo\"Dip for your beautiful fries, my tongue you did K.O.I'm not your biggest fanBut every now and then I want theeLove Wurst, love WurstkucheI'm Yelp!

It definitely lives up to the hype. I went on a Saturday night around 7:30 and there was a line, but it wasn't crazy. And the line moves really fast. I went with the standard brat since it was my first time. It was really good! I got spicy peppers and sauerkraut on it as well (I believe you get two toppings free). I also ordered the belgian fries, which comes with two dipping sauces so I got the chipotle aioli and chipotle ketchup - both were excellent with the fries. I feel like you can't go wrong with anything you order here. Everyone in our group enjoyed their food and I think the lamb sausage was the biggest hit. They also have a good selection of german and belgian beers. Another perk is that they take your beer order while you're in line and bring it to you while you're in line (this makes standing in line a little bit better!) They also stress the importance of knowing what you are going to order before you get up to the register. This makes the line move ALOT faster, which is good. Also, this is more of a group gathering place rather than a date kind of place. The restaurant was really loud and most of the seating is in the form of long picnic-style tables.In sum, this is definitely a good option for a quick, relatively inexpensive dinner in LA!"},{"date":"2014-02-20","rating":"4.0","review":"We came here late on a Sunday night after flying into LA from NYC. We probably arrived between 9 and 10pm, and there was still a line outside the doors to order! I always like coming here because it reminds me of my days spent living in Germany...more specifically nights spent at the  KulturBraueri in Berlin. This night I went with my Italian. He has never been here, and being from Italy doesn't think of German food as anything anyone would ever desire to eat, but after eating the Rabbit, Veal & Pork seasoned with White Wine sausage, he wanted more! I had my favorite Polish Kielbasa followed by the Hot Italian (sausage, not my date). The fries were warm, crisp and delicious, accompanied by the sauces that always make them more interesting.Drinks were good, but let's be honest, we didn't come here for the drinks. We came for a unique experience...outdoor eating style indoors, loud music, and good food, to hold us over until we can enjoy it back in Berlin again."},{"date":"2012-04-14","rating":"5.0","review":"Wunderbar!  Wunderschoen! Bravo!There's nothing better than craving a big juicy wurst and getting a big juicy wurst. Rattlesnake and rabbit- My favorite. A bit spicy and tastes even better when you eat the sausage alone. The sweet peppers are really good but sometimes they overpower the taste of the sausage. Kielbasa- Just spicy enough and just right. Loved it. Duck and bacon sausage- Tastes more like bacon than duck. NEED MORE DUCK.And how can I forget the truffle fries??? Those were HEAVEN. Pesto sauce and bacon sauce were both divine.

Once with my mother and the following night with my foodie crew right after eating at Guisados in Echo Park. The place is that cool.Located in the arts district, Wurstkuche is this hidden gem of a restaurant that serves unique bratwursts and bold tasting brew. THE FOOD:* The rattlesnake with rabbit: All I have to say is that it was delicious. Nothing really tasted bizarre or distinct to me. It was just a great sausage. Light and buttery.* The bacon with duck: This bratwurst had a little more of a bold flavor given that it had bacon in it. A little salty and juicy. Delicious, but I prefer the rattlesnake more. * The Filipino Maharlika: maharlika means 'royal' fyi. As a Filipino, this sausage took me by surprise by literally being an elongated longanisa, which is an actual Filipino sausage. Sweet and light. THE BREW:* I drank the Shneider Weisse and Franziskaner. Great beers, just like Heffen WeisseTHE DESSERT:* So there's only one dessert on the menu which you pick up at the bar in the back. It is an ice cream sandwich made with apple pie ice cream in between oatmeal raisin cookies. This dessert was surprisingly better than I expected it to be. The cookies were fair, but the ice cream was superb. THE AMBIANCE:* Nice and hip place. The interior design is sophisticated with a dim light set-up, community tables, wooden benches, a back bar, a DJ, and an outside patio. I recommend sitting outside in the patio as it can get really loud inside and you basically have to yell at your friend to tell him that the beer tab is on him. Also, it's nice to just appreciate all the artistic commotion happening all around you in the arts district.PARKING:* Never have an issue with parking. There's always parking on the street."},{"date":"2013-09-20","rating":"5.0","review":"YUM!I am a vegetarian so I don't get to eat meat but I sometimes crave it!  I LOVE the Vegetarian Apple Sausage so much.  It's delicious!  Their beer selection is really good too.  I love the Apple Cider!If you're looking to go have a good casual time with some friends, GO here!"},{"date":"2014-10-22","rating":"5.0","review":"Sausage + beer + fries = happy.  Wurstkuche didn't invent this concept, but they certainly have taken this simple formula to another level.  This is one of my favorite places in the world because of the attention they gave to each component of the meal.The sausages range from traditional German bratwurst to exotic nonsense like rattlesnake (which, actually, is pretty tasty).  Every sausage I've had has been delightful, but lamb remains my favorite.  Each one is well seasoned and grilled to perfection, served on a quality bun with whatever toppings you want.Wurstkuche serves a range of quality German beers, and they even serve it by the liter depending on how happy you want to become, or how soon you intend to operate machinery.  If you aren't familiar with the wonders of deutchebier, the friendly bar staff can help guide you to the appropriate style.Even the fries are well prepared, and are served with a variety of creative dipping sauces.  They're thick-cut, and are best shared."},{"date":"2014-10-22","rating":"5.0","review":"Great vegetarian options and good beer!"},{"date":"2014-06-07","rating":"5.0","review":"Delicious!!

Without the glaze, it can be a bit on the salty side, so be sure to get it! The mayo and chipotle were definitely good add-ons to the fries.My beer was like any malty beer, so if you are into Guinness, the Schwarzbier is a great pick.

It didn't make me hot and bothered but it was a little sweet. I don't know though, it wasn't even juicy that day. They do have exotics though, if you're interested in that sorta thing. Meh."},{"date":"2013-05-20","rating":"4.0","review":"Duck and bacon wurst. Thick, crisp steak fries with truffle oil. Walnut-blue cheese dipping sauce. Savory city. I must admit, since my first lovely German beer was served while waiting in line, I might have killed it before the food even came, hence making it taste even better (a little beer high), but wow, that duck sausage was FLAVORFUL. The bacon element was subtle and not overwhelming, and paired with onions and spicy peppers, it was just divine. Fries are dangerous... as I've previously said, truffle is my jam, and I would probably eat a little toe off a dead body if it had a truffle glaze on it, so these were like my kryptonite. Great dipping sauce options, but if you must choose one the walnut-blue cheese is the way to go. Not very pungent cheesy, just uniquely delicious. I wouldn't have gotten it if it weren't recommended, and I'm glad I did.Kickass beer list: great Euro options on draft and an impressive bottle selection. They had the Weihenstephaner Fresh Hops, which I had never seen or heard of-- evidently it was created by the students of the Braumeister program there, and I must say: good job, students! Of course the selection's going to change with what's available, but from what I saw, you can trust there will always be a perfect beer for your brat.

Who would have thought our first time eating it would be in downtown LA?We got their for lunch and and ordered the rattlesnake & rabbit with jalapeno pepper $7.50, duck & bacon with jalapeno peppers $7.50, and groot-large belgian fries served with chipotle aioli $5.50.  The restaurant was very modern. It had a sleek minimalist presentation and a layout that encouraged socializing.  After the short wait the food came out and we all dug in. We liked everything for the most part, but think our adventurous sausage selection distracted from us really enjoying the meal. We both agreed that the rattlesnake & rabbit was the better of the two sausages.  It's hard to describe it's taste, but overall it was good. It was lighter in color, almost white and it tasted pretty much the same as a usual sausage.  Maybe just a little softer and easier to bite through.  The duck & bacon had a strong gamey taste that put us both off and we had a hard time finishing it.  We think our favorite part of the meal was the Belgian fries with the chipotle aioli sauce.  They were big natural cut fries that were crispy outside and soft on the inside.We both agreed that the food quality was very good and it probably would have tasted amazing if we would have just tried one of their more traditional sausages.  Although we didn't generally love the two exotic sausages we tried, there is no doubt in our minds that Wurstküche serves a high quality foods.  Next time be come back we'll try some of their more traditional sausages."},{"date":"2013-04-20","rating":"4.0","review":"Had put this review up for Wurstkuche Venice and received many requests to put it up here (3rd St. Location) so here it is! All the information is accurate for both locations (even parking!!) (:This review will be a kind, helpful compass for your heart's innate desire to try Wurstkuche Venice. I understand how difficult and, at times, terrifying trying a new place is and the more \"hip\" and \"underground\" the establishment, the darker the cloud of \"am I cool enough to frequent that store,\" becomes. But don't you worry! Take my hand! Follow me, Alice! into Wurstkuche Land!If you're thinking of coming to this place with a couple of your buddies to have a great time, I'd just like to say, good choice! But with every great decision comes some great pains in the ass. Parking: Get all the pals packed into one car. Street parking is free after the sun goes down (so I want to say 7? 8?) and there are some parking lots in the vicinity that are flat-rates ($5-7) but good luck finding parking around here, because by dinnertime, the beer fanatics and sausage shin diggers come out of their man-caves and park their ponies throughout the land, leaving us outsiders with few spaces for asses of our own.[Btw, Google Maps, like the 90% of the other times, has a hard time finding this place so do try to get a head start to leave time to get lost. Then lost again.]A. If you have a group of 4 or more, may I suggest finding seating first. It's ok, just go on ahead through the two large kryptonite doors, past the ridiculously long line of people studying the vast menu, through the dark hallway and into the warehouse of picnic tables already packed like sardines. There are no hostesses here so you've got to hunt down your own territory, hold down the fort and send off a few members back to the entrance to place an order for the pack. And loan them some jackets, because they'll be standing outside for a while.Normally, you order, pay, then seat. That's the way the sausage spins around here. B. Suggestion: study the menu quickly and thoroughly for it is daunting and in 2.5 font. 1. Start with your sausages (choose from: classic, gourmet, and exotic categories)Recommendations [warning : spicy]Classic - Bockwurst / Gourmet - Austin Blues or Mango Jalapeno / Exotic - Rattlesnake n Rabbit or Duck n Bacon2. Pick two toppings : recommend - caramelized onions & spicy peppers3. Get: White Truffle Oil Glazed Fries with Chipotle Aioli & Sweet n Sassy BBQ sauces4. Choose beer. (Recommendation unavailable - to each his own!)C. After paying, the few, the brave, the chosen-to-stand outside for half n hour for the greater good of the group will rejoin the pack with a plastic number stand thingy. Be a good herd of customers and make sure the numbers are facing the DJ who will be blasting nonsense for your entertainment, from by the wall closest to the dark hallway we mentioned. This way, the waitresses can come right out of the kitchen, spot your number amongst the sea of feeding frenzies, and you can be on your way to suculent sausage nirvana. D. Warm up vocals, do some pitch and shout exercises to prepare for a night of continuous screaming. The place is ridiculously loud and you WILL not hear your buddies across the table and you dont want to grease up your phones by trying to text each other \"pass the ketchup and all 5 other sauces.\"E. No, you may not pick up men or women here because it will just look like an angry man or woman on a psychotic breakdown is randomly screaming, \"TWATS YER BURGER?!\" into the face of a terrified man or woman with a sausage in their mouths, all in an innocent attempt to get their phone number. F. If you have a girlfriend who talks too much or have a boyfriend with a \"special\" laugh, this place is perfect for you! No matter how many sound barriers your friend's new girl can shatter, it will be no match to the wall of sound behind these kryptonite doors. You can also master the \"smile and nod\" art of communication here and take home a nice thick napkin as a certificate of your newly obtained Ph.D.I know it was long but thanks for bearing with me! Hope that gave you some necessary insight into this mysterious land of sausages and angry-sounding languages but now you're more prepared! One pill makes you larger, one pill makes you small, but the ones that Wurstkuche gives you is the greatest of them all! I usually spend about $20 here (exotic-fries-beer) so there's your ESA: estimated spending amount~ No, that is not a real thing, yes it is totally worth it.Enjoy!"},{"date":"2014-06-19","rating":"4.0","review":"I've been to the Santa Monica location as well as this one near Little Tokyo.

Not to mention, smacked in the middle of the Art District, immersed with the beautiful LA culture.Best thing: They had vegetarian options! I love places that have vegetarian meat! I had the classic vegetarian hotdog with bellpeppers and onions. The hotdog serving size (sausage thickness and length) is larger than the one I had in Pasadena at Hot Dog Haus. I had the vegetarian Italian; it was enriched with great spices and cooked well. Truffle fries with chiptole sauce was O-M-G YUMMY! Heard the reviews about the fries and totally worth every calorie and live to it's hype, definitely! They have a variety of condiments: honey mustard, dijon, ketchup, etc. I was heartbroken that they didn't have honey dijon mustard, HAHAH! For me, it's not a meal until it's accompanied with a great, wheaty beer! The gentleman recommended the Franziskaner, served in a tall glass. I wasn't able to finish it sadly, but it was good quality beer. Gah, I love beer!The service: on point. The staff was very knowledgable about their menu and helpful with recommending what to what. Also, the server to delievered the food was very kind and prompt. I don't remember waiting that long either. Then again, I went around 4pm on a Thursday summer late afternoon. The way the venue is created is ordering in the front and follow the small pathway to your seating. Wood decor and brick walls = awesome. There is a small seating area outside in their patio - very small though. Probably seats like 10 people? Overall, great first experience. I love the ambiance it brings!

DO NOT READ!Finally, I get around to writing about this sausage spot. I came here with a pal of mine who insisted I must try everything. While I would have liked to try \"everything,\" I was a little afraid that the sausages were going to be more \"eh\" than \"yeah.\" However, I found that these links were so delicious, they blew my mind! It was Saturday night and we waited in a very long line that seemed as if were were waiting to see a concert. I could hear the other patrons, who were of the L.A. hipster stock, rave about the sausages here. My friend comments on how he's had the \"rabbit and rattlesnake\" and wanted to try the \"duck and bacon.\" Being someone who does not typically eat exotic meats, I decided I wanted to try the crocodile pork andouille, a highly un-kosher choice of treif treachery. As we finally got to the register and make our order, I was sadly informed that the kitchen was out of my exotic sausage of the night. I then asked for a ground up whiny hipster with jalapenos, and they were out of those too. So I opted for the rabbit and rattle snake and my friend decided on the duck and bacon and (what was he thinking) chicken and apple.We also ordered fries with blue cheese and walnut dip. We got our number and headed down a long corridor until we reached a very crowded seating area, which looked like a German minimalist dungeon/ summer picnic indoors. A DJ was playing techno dance music. This is a food rave, only the real party is in your mouth. (That didn't sound right.)We needed beer too. Wurstküche boasts a very large collection of beers. I asked my pal to choose for me because I am a Libra and I am indecisive. So I got something dark and malty, which was good. The rabbit and rattlesnake was satisfying and juicy. It was a tad bit spicy and savory. However,  I didn't feel naughty enough for devouring this exotic link that included a cute animal and poisonous reptile; my mind was still on what I can't have which is the Crocodile pork. Sigh.The Duck and Bacon was fatty, juicy and succulent. I did not try the Chicken and Apple because I had it before and if you had a Chicken and Apple sausage anywhere, you know what to expect: sweetness from apples and savory from the chicken. Not bad, but it doesn't butter my pan.The fries were fries and being fries, they can only get better with dips. The blue cheese walnut dip is so amazing that the dip by itself can substitute for the fries. I highly recommend it.Reminder folks: If you are going to Wurstküche, order something crazy. You can buy Chicken and Apple sausages at most grocery stores.Some wise man once did not say to me, \"The bigger the sausage, the better the pleasure.\" I am certain this applies to Wurstküche; each juicy and delicious sausage is packing a whole lot of....flavor!"},{"date":"2014-10-15","rating":"4.0","review":"Love the food and drink here.  Hot dawg!   It can get really loud.  Fun to go with a party.  Good times."},{"date":"2013-10-04","rating":"4.0","review":"Decided to write a review for this place (finally...even though I've been here numerous times before) because I went for dinner tonight, and for some reason, it was just SO GOOD. I literally took a bite and had to make a comment about how delicious it was at that moment. It was like a sausage epiphany, if such a thing exists.My usual is the sun dried tomato and mozzarella sausage with caramelized onions. I'm not huge on sauces, which these tables do not lack so I just squirt some good ole ketchup on there and it's just as good as ever. Tonight I opted out of beer and tried the nesbitts strawberry soda, which was perfect. The belgian fries fresh out of the fryer are TO DIE FOR. I recommend the chipotle aioli and sundried tomato mayo sauces for it.I like the ambience, with the young and hip crowd. Although the cafeteria-style seating with the long tables and benches aren't great for groups (contrary to what you'd think...) because people tend to sit at sporadic spots. Also it gets pretty packed on weekend nights. But if you're craving some sausage, good beer, and a fun hangout with a couple friends, this is the spot.Usually parking is never too much trouble, but tonight I had to make 3-4 rounds in the surrounding streets before I could finally snag a space.Service is great.

You'll almost always end up disappointed.The parking situation is a complete drag. The neighborhoods surrounding Wurstkuche are your best bet, but they're all already pretty damn packed. After finally squeezing into a parking space nearby, I wandered in to meet my friends. I wound up ordering the only option on the entire menu that wasn't vegetarian/didn't have a pork casing: the chicken apple sausage. I was a bit disappointed because I really wanted to try the other options, like pheasant or even rattlesnake, but pork makes me sick (a food allergy, if you will), so I had to settle for the chicken. Along with a side of fries.The saving grace was the array of spicy dipping sauces, which I loved. Along with the overall ambiance of the place - it was like a cabin, all warm wood and evergreen undertones.

And the fries are fat chips, not French skinny fries, and come with a choice of 2 dipping sauces (tzatziki and bleu cheese walnut.) They were tasty, but they could've been cooked in hotter oil to get the crispiness that gets lost when they stew in luke warm fat. (My Dad used to own a fish and chip shop that I worked in.)I tried a bite of Sam's chicken and green chilli and cilantro sausage.

Tastewise, it's good but not AMAAAAZING hence the 4 stars! But they definitely have a very unique and exotic flair. I came here with about 30 other people and we had a little room reserved in the back with 3 tables. Dark, minimalist, cool ambience. They have a very wide selection of German and Belgian beer as well as unique non-alcoholic bottled beverages. I had a German beer called the Reissdorf Kolsch. It was light and crisp, just the way I like it. My friend and I shared 3 sausages and we put caramelized onions and sweet peppers as our choice of 2 toppings on all of them:1. Mango Jalapeno - unique and yummy! 2. Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers - the best one!! I loved the flavors! Very exotic and juicy, and a little spicy too. Popular choice for sure. 3. Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers - I was really disappointed by this one. I thought it'd taste really crazyfunkyweird but it tasted like... chicken. Pretty plain... nothing too memorable about it really.The sausages were about $7-8 each so it's a little pricier than average. Portions are also pretty small (for a guy especially) so it may not be completely worth the money if you're not a big sausage fan but hey, the different sausages are so exotic and unique! Where else are you going to find a sausage like that in LA?

We stumbled upon this place while walking around downtown art district.  We didn't realized it was a restaurant until we saw outdoor patio seating.  There's two entrance, one leads you to the patio indoor and outdoor seating, the other leads you to the ordering area.  I didn't feel like eating crocodile, rabbit, or lamb this day so I stuck with the classic italian spicy dog.  You get to choose two toppings with each dog and big bottle of condiments are available at each table. I recommend getting the white truffle oil glaze Belgium  fries with their variety of  special sauce which is 0.75 cent each, which was a bit steep, seeing that you only get a tiny cup of dipping sauce.  After you ordered, you get a number and they bring it to you and water infused with cucumbers are available for your drinking needs. My spicy italian was great, I added mustard and ketchup along with spicy pepper, and caramelized onions.

I enjoyed the various selections of different mustard and the beer selection was great, a few Rasputin's which were recommended and I thoroughly loved it. The thick Belgian style fried are so good and couldn't get enough, but what pissed me off was that because my younger bros license had expired and since he forgot his current one at home he wasn't allowed to drink which I feel is a load of crap since its California law that one must be 21 to consume alcohol with PROOF! Of age so what if his license was expired it clearly shows his birthday its not like the guy was 15 and trying to pass for 21 on a side not the same thing happened just across the street at the LA Brewery. Everything is street parking and to top it off if your in the outside table area your not allowed to fucking smoke? The dumbass security guard was busting our balls so we just left.

So, lets talk mustard. I am not a HUGE fan of mustard especially the bright yellow variety, but there really is no other condiment for a sausage of any variety other than mustard. After you place your order make your journey to the back and take a spot at a long communal table or at a coffin, from there you should spot a gaggle of mustards - just hanging out waiting to be enjoyed. In fact, there will be three mustards and ketchup (lucky ketchup). Each of these mustards are very nice and bring out the flavor of your sausage creation. For example, the rabbit paired very nicely with the Dijon, it called for a smoother more mild mustard. While the Austin Blue needed a stronger - whole grain mustard to stand up to the spices. Play with your food - find your match. Chipotle Aoili - wonderful, give it a shot Curry Ketchup - Curry. Ketchup. Tastes exactly like you think Curry Ketchup would... Note for virgins: if you enter into a large room with a bar, you will never get food. You can go back outside and enter in the other door, or you can journey down the hallway and get in the register line (if the line is long they'll serve beer in line). I do suggest you go with a friend and you order one from each section of the menu maybe two from the exotics - and vary your toppings - don't forget a large fries to share."},{"date":"2013-11-11","rating":"4.0","review":"The staff was absolutely awesome!

I almost handed my $4 to some guy in the lot. I guess if one wants to hang out and make some exttra $ for an hour collecting fees it wouldn't be a bad idea.There was a line to the single cash register, a small refrigerated case displayed the different sausages. I ordered the rabbit and rattle snake while I wondered which portions of both were included.  We sat in the back at cafeteria style long tables and ordered our first round of beers. Beers are on tap, they'll let you taste before you order. The food was ok, I wasn't floored. My combo came out to $24 (without the brew) and I got the Belgian fries. It was fun to hang out.

I have to agree with many Yelpers that the the buns are lacking here, but I suppose anything better would overshadow the sausage.We also split some Belgian fries, which we added the White Truffle Oil Glaze to (yum!). The fries we'rent the best I've had, but they were good... albeit a bit overcooked. We had them with the Chipotle Aioli and the Curry Ketchup, both delicious! I'd recommend the Chipotle Aioli if you're only getting one.The beer selection is nice and extensive, and not too overly priced - had a great large glass of German Franziskaner! yum. You can skip the line and head straight to the bar for alcohol if you don't want food... or split the group and be efficient ordering.There are tables in the back, through the corridor beside the front cashier/ordering station. There is also a small outdoor patio area accessible through the door at the end of the corridor. They have a decent late-night crowd, so seats can be hard to come by... if you're in a group, work together to get food, drinks, and a table."},{"date":"2012-03-04","rating":"5.0","review":"Wurstkuche (literally means \"sausage kitchen\" in German)... Went here last night... what an experience and totally worth the 30 minute wait just to order. They give you you  beer while you wait which is nice.

I got the fries as well and the aoili was bomb!It feels like you are walking to a nightclub when you go to the seating area.... imagine a long, dark hallway that leads to a giant room complete with a full bar and a DJ spinning Euro tunes.

I was tempted to try the one with mango and jalapeno, but maybe next time. The fries weren't that great, it tasted a bit burnt, but the waitress said that's just what Belgian fries tasted like. I'm not sure if that's true, but we dealt with it and ate it. The chipotle aiole tasted great. This is a unique place, expect to spend at least $8 for a brat. There's always a line as well.

I've never been to a sausage shop before in my life, as I had a preconception it wouldn't be any different than just boiling a hot dog at home. When I looked at the menu, I had some sticker shock at the prices for the sausages, but the place looked very hip and trendy, so I figured that's why. I definitely recommend this place for a date, as the vibe is very cool. I decided to go very conservative with my order and got a beef kielbasa with spicy chipotle ketchup. Some of my friends ordered the exotic sausages like rattlesnake or pheasant. When we got our orders, everyone at the table was very happy with their dishes. For me, the spiciness from the chipotle ketchup was tuned just perfectly. I'm not sure if the beef kielbasa has any spiciness of its own. I do not hesitate to recommend this place, especially to someone wary of sausage."},{"date":"2013-10-01","rating":"4.0","review":"Wurstkuche, y u no buns !?!?!?!The one time I was able to bring my friend Jeff to try Wurstkuche's wonderful belgian fries -- with truffle oil -- they ran out of buns.The hipster girl taking orders gave us attitude when we asked about the lack of buns.When you order your belgian fries, be specific about getting truffle oil.As Jeff found out, they also serve plain belgian fries, which aren't worth your time.The dining area is staged to have a precisely calibrated level of darkness and chaotic lack of seating; it's hard to carry a conversation here, so enjoy the food, nod, and pretend to understand what your dining companions are saying."},{"date":"2014-09-29","rating":"5.0","review":"Lived in Berlin.

Also tried the crocodile and it was okay. We were group of 10 and about half the group liked their food and the other half didn't. So, it depends on what you order. However, I did like the selection. You could order more exotic meats or go vegetarian. So something for everyone. The décor inside resembles a make shift German beer hall inside a warehouse, trying to be a club, with really loud music playing in the background. So similar to it's offering of brats, a little bit of something for everyone. However, something needs to be done with the buns. Wurstkuche could take some pointers from Franks 'N' Dawgs in Chicago. When we went it was way too hot inside, so not too comfortable. But it was an interesting place to hang out with friends for a quick and casual bite.

The ratio of adults to children under 5 was about 1:1.  Some kids were scribbling their \"artwork\" on the tables.  We had PBR (only $2.50) and a sausage each.  My exotic duck and bacon sausage did not impress. The sausage was not all that flavorful despite the chipotle peppers and the bun was not nearly as good as the buns at Bru Haus. The fries were a bit on the cold side but the Bleu Cheese dip was definitely the highlight.

An aside - there's a guy in Denver who is supposedly amazing.  Regardless, here are the problems: we had burnt fries.  I mean fuck you seriously?  You serve me twice cooked fries that you think are Belgian style - but are fooling the LA masses with that \"burnt essence\".

Location is a very hipster-esque area with artsy walls, little shops, and barely any parking available.There is always a line here, but if you're with friends, it's not too long of a wait. Grab a menu, make your order at the register, grab some water + condiments, and then find a table. They'll find you and give you your order.I like the wide range of sausage choices, and kudos to vegetarian options. I wasn't feeling trying anything exotic so I got a mango & jalapeno kind but was very satisfied in the flavor. Sweet and spicy but not very salty like most hot dogs/sausages. I definitely recommend that with onions and Dijon mustard. We also got two orders of the Klein (small) fries to share among three people. The portions were more than enough. They're tasty, but really don't go overboard with them and share. After eating the sausage and the fries, I felt a little too bloated with everything being fried and greasy.It's a cool joint, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who has not tried it before.Also, I heard their ice cream sandwiches are good. I'll have to give it a try next time. Oh, and Pie Hole is right across the street if you're feeling more dessert!"},{"date":"2013-10-30","rating":"1.0","review":"You will wait in line 25 minutes to an hour because they only have one computer to take orders. Basically \"ironic\" customer service from hipsters who rely more on being trendy than creating a good dining experience.Plus, you get: Bland forgettable food. Noisy atmosphere. Dirt and dust covering the overhead AC vents. (Do you want dust and dirt blowing into your food? I don't). My advice: Don't believe the hype.What a huge disappointment. My gf heard amazing things about this place and finally convinced me to go. I had my doubts because the times I walked by Wurstkuche, it seemed more like a late-night meat market for single hipsters, pumping techno with flowing small-batch beer, low lights and too many annoyingly dressed losers to count.I was right - this place is more concerned with looking cool and hip than it is with actually creating a positive customer experience. If they are even slightly busy, you will wait in line for an hour, and the food is just OK. It's mostly brats and fries and hipster-inspired vegan sausages and dipping sauces. Nothing memorable, basically a glorified hot dog stand.The only reason they are so popular is the location, super cool decor, and the fact that it converts to a late-night hipster meat market designed to help girls with facial piercings drink beers with guys who just cut their second full-length ukulele album featuring native Ugandan love songs. Yes, their SECOND uke album.First off, the ultra-modern industrial design is lame and overdone. Second, they spent thousands of dollars on the decor, but the layout of the front entrance is poorly thought-out and frustrating.The owners apparently have no experience running a restaurant because they thought one point of sale computer would be enough to handle the heavy flow of customers. They were wrong. If you get there between 6 and 7pm, or again between 8:30 and 9:30 you WILL stand in line - waiting to order - for at least 25 minutes, and as long as an hour. There are actually five feet of wasted counter space next to the one ordering computer but that space is used to display 20 super hip, free-range, locally sourced and ethically-bottled sodas.Hey hipster owners! There is no excuse for such poor regard for your customers. Take down the soda display and ADD A SECOND ORDERING STATION!When I finally got to place my order (30 minutes later), I asked the polite and smiling girl if anyone at the restaurant has ever considered adding a second computer with which to take orders. Her response typified the hipster work ethic and \"ironic\" approach to customer service... \"Yeah, a lot of people ask that question, but the line only gets this long, like, twice a day for an hour each time, so... we only have one computer.\" Umm... hello? Did you hear what you just said? That's called a \"dinner rush\" and your ordering system should be able to handle it!Perhaps the most frustrating part of their indifference to good customer service is that the kitchen staff who are right behind the cashier can EASILY handle the rate at which the tickets come in, so the only bottleneck is the single ordering computer. Another hipster constantly walks the long line of patient customers, ferrying them in the door to keep the sidewalk clear and getting them beers, but this is little comfort for non-drinkers like me. Instead of actually helping the line move faster by taking orders, he's pressing the flesh while comparing the last Radiohead album to the writings of Proust.This place is not a true restaurant interested in taking care of their customers. It is another ultra-hip, overhyped and poorly run hipster hangout. They don't care that you have to stand in line for 30 minutes to an hour just to order a hot dog. They are more interested in spinning their latest vinyl (yes, there is a DJ stand inside), cutting their jeans into jeans shorts and twirling their ironic handlebar moustaches.Simply adding another POS computer would cut the wait in half, but these guys are too dumb to double their turnaround and alleviate their loyal customers' long wait. The only people who rave about this waste of natural wood grain and industrial steel must be more interested in seeing and being seen than they are in actually having a fast convenient dining experience.

Wurstkuche definitely has all the hype about it but sometimes, I don't think it lives up to its hype. They can make a decent hotdog, but I prefer mine to be smothered in whatever sauces they offer, like at Pink's. It's definitely for a different crowd; those wanting a different type of hotdog - a less calorie-horrific option and probably for those who want to savour the bratwurst/sausage without the distractions of heaped chilli or coleslaw.Wurstkuche is great for a group of friends hanging out. It's a hip place in the Arts District; all that jazz with the red brick walls and modern chairs. The servers are great and super friendly - quick to help out and great at recommendations. I love the fries here and they're as natural tasting as you can get. They're thick cut fries and have amazing dips to go with them. I've tried the aioli and bacon dip so far and they're so good.

And their fries and curry ketchup were far better than I remember- crispy with a good amount of salt, and pungent, respectively. Bottom line, its good sausage... but its not the BEST sausage."},{"date":"2013-05-08","rating":"4.0","review":"Although the line for this place can get pretty crazy, it is definitely worth it to check it out.As other people have stated they have a wide variety of different kinds of hot dogs/sausages/bratwurst you won't find at your neighborhood store. Many include animals like rabbit/alligator/snake, etc.While I have to admit they didn't really taste THAT different since I wouldn't really know what those animals taste like normally anyways. The selection of beers is nice and they have some refreshing drinks as well. You MUST get the truffle fries. These are so so good.I'll be back, but probably at a time when they aren't so busy.

The whole restaurant works kinda like Father's office where you make your order at the bar, you get a number and the waiters come around and find you with your food.I had the rabbit and rattlesnake hotdog because I wanted to try something different. I thought it would be smelly and gamy, but it was actually very juicy and tasty!  static.px.yelp.com/bphot…  I also got a Franzikaner (a german beer that was suggested by the bartender) static.px.yelp.com/bphot…  I don't know much about beer but it was pretty good~ and it definitely went very well with my rabbit and rattlesnake hotdog! :DI heard there is always a line here and it is hard to find seats especially on weekend nights.  We went there around 4pm on a Wednesday.  There were decent amount of people in there, but we didn't have to wait in line and there were many open seats!  I suggest you go there early and avoid the weekends if you don't want to wait too long :)I am not sure if this place deserves a 4 star or a 5 star because we went at such an odd time.  I was very impressed with the hotdog and the recommended beer... but I don't know if this place deserves a 5 just yet.  I am just wondering how this place will be when it is crowded.  Where would we park when there are a lot of people?  How quick is their service?  I definitely want to try their other hotdogs.  I heard the duck and bacon sausage is pretty good too.  They are also known for the fries and their own dipping sauces.Wurstküche, I will be back!"},{"date":"2011-10-13","rating":"4.0","review":"Rattlesnake!

I wouldn't say they're the best hot dogs, and despite the plethora of non-standard meats, they're not really the most unique either. That said, you won't be disappointed.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is appealing; there is an industrial feel that perfectly complements the surrounding center of the restaurant. But enough about the atmosphere, let's get down to the nitty gritty, the main reason I came: thick sausage. The hot dog was great. I sampled some of the many sauces they provide to their customers. I didn't know which sauce was best, so I took a little squirt of each...My first bite was riveting. The succulent, smoky juices squirted out of the sausage, and the sweet flavor of the onions gave the weenie the kick it needed.

My favorites are the Austin Blues, and the Spicy Bratwurst, both with carmelized onions and peppers. The sausages are super juicy and flavorful. The toasted bun also soaks up all the juices that seep out from the sausage when you bite into it. The thick cut Belgian fries are to die for! Crispy on the outside and really creamy on the inside. The dipping sauces are really good too. My favorites are Pesto mayo and Chipotle aoili. They also have a great selection of beers on tap.

This is right near little tokyo, It is just really convenient. 2) Beer. I hate beer. I don't actually drink any carbohydrate drinks. But I did enjoy the fruity belgium beer my friend ordered for me.

The food is very good quality and consistent."},{"date":"2010-06-03","rating":"4.0","review":"I'd give this place 5 stars if the prices were a little cheaper. I mean, they get hundreds of customers a day and probably make a lot of money from the bar, so I'm pretty sure that they have enough money to pay for the expensive downtown LA rent and then some. If they lower the prices like a dollar or two across the board, this place would get that rare 5 stars.At any rate, I went along with the crowd and ordered the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers and the Duck & Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers. Both were pretty delicious. Of the two, I'd recommend the Duck & Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers. I thought it had more flavor/taste. I want to come back here and try some of the other sausages. I also got the Belgian Fries with White Truffle Oil Glaze and Bleu Cheese Walnut and Bacon Dipping Sauce--this sauce was pretty damn good. For beer, I got the strongest beer they had: Aventinus Eisbock German Beer 12% ABV. Retrospectively, I should have asked the bartender what beer would go well with the sausages I ordered. Although, he did say that this beer does go well with spicy food--what I happened to order.Luckily, I came at a time where there was no line and lots of space in the seating area. The seating area, by the way, was a nice picnic table setup. I wonder what this place looks like when it's busy. Good thing I came a non-peak hour time.I'd prefer this place over Pink's Hot Dogs because of the atmosphere, availability of alcohol, and nicer seating area (indoors and outdoors).

He said it was a \"short distance\" away, but didn't really describe how far it was. Turns out it was about a 10-minute walk from the Downtown Independent to Wurstküche (which was fine), and the only reason I was a bit turned off from the place when first getting there was because 1) I had never roamed this part of Los Angeles at night and 2) people screaming at each other about a block away was making me question what his idea of a safe area was. Needless to say, though it was a busy Friday night, the hostess was very accommodating to everyone in line, and was constantly asking everyone if they needed any sort of drinks for the wait, if everyone had a menu, etc. From getting in line outside, ordering for four, and waiting for our food to go, everything took about 30-35 minutes? I wasn't brave enough to try the rattlesnake and rabbit (though my friends who went there previously had it and said it was delicious), I went for the bratwurst with sweet peppers and sauerkraut with a large set of fries to share, and my boyfriend ordered the bratwurst on its own.  Everything there was absolutely delicious that I had tried, especially the fries. Seriously, I ordered a large fries to split, and I could have easily had them on their own. I would recommend them with the buttermilk ranch, but if you're not into that, it's cool. Definitely wouldn't stay in the seating area for something like a date, but it's a lot of fun with the DJ, loud noise, and the massive amount of others at the picnic-styled benches!"},{"date":"2013-04-26","rating":"4.0","review":"This place holds a very special place in my heart :)  I met one of my favorite actors here...

But moving onto the important stuff :)... The duck, crocodile and rattlesnake were all amazingly good.  They are cooked to perfection with just the right amount of snap and still juicy and tender on the inside.  I would also recommend the filipino.  You really can't go wrong with anything you decide to have here, but i tend to choose the exotics because you really can't get them at any other places.For those who enjoy alcohol they have an eclectic beer selection and an array of gourmet sodas to choose from.  This place is a must try at least once!  Do as i did and go with a group of people and order a bunch of stuff on the menu and share so you can try a bunch of different sausages."},{"date":"2015-03-05","rating":"5.0","review":"The food here is amazing!!

I guess they'll just have to read about it on Yelp!  This place gets very busy specially during lunch and dinner time but you can call in your order to save some time.  But I prefer just going off peak hours like 11pm.  Wurstkuche has some of the most exotic sausages I've ever seen on one menu like the rattlesnake, buffalo, alligator, and rabbit.  If you're not feeling too adventurous, they offer \"regular\" sausages like polish, chicken, and pork.  However the best thing about this place are the Belgian fries.  Wurstkuche has THE BEST Belgian fries this side of the hemisphere but only if you don't skimp out on the white truffle oil glaze for an extra $1.50.  You also have a choice from a variety of sauces like chipotle aioli, pesto mayo, and curry ketchup to dip your fries in just to enhance the experience.          And to top it off, they have a great selection of Belgian and German beers on tap and bottled.  If you're not in the mood for beer, their selection of non-alcoholic beverage is just as unique (ie. Q Cumber soda and ginger beer).I'll definitely be back!"},{"date":"2015-03-04","rating":"5.0","review":"Really enjoyed this place and I'd definitely come back!!"},{"date":"2013-08-08","rating":"5.0","review":"Although I've always stuck to one of the safer choices here (chicken apple sausage), I have to say everything looks always looks really good.

What more can a person want from a hipster gastropub??Located near the edge of Little Tokyo where a lot of gentrification has occurred, it's a quaint place where you can stuff yourself with fancy hot dogs and beer while listening to great music blast through the speakers. I have no bias when it comes to sausages, so I was excited to learn about the duck/bacon sausage, which I ordered with sauerkraut. Two of my favorite meats? Yes please! Unfortunately, it was a little tough and not as satisfying as a pork/bacon dog would be for me, but then again, that's just a little redundant.Any place that has a beer selection with at least one tasty fruity beer gets a plus in my book, but gets an even bigger plus when they have Framboise. It's raspberry beer, tastes just like juice, and doesn't taste like real beer at all. So good for a pansy drinker like me, but unfortunately it comes in a bottle here. I've also tried the Fruli, which is a strawberry beer (also good, but not as sour as I'd like), and the apple ale (also not as sour). Multiple fruity beer selections? I can actually be a regular customer!The line is usually ridiculously long if you want to order sausages, but if you want to just order alcohol you can enter through the back and order from the bar. Fun fact: they have $5 steins with Pbr, for those who just want a giant beer.

We turned onto a dark street and my friend and I looked at each other with wary. \"Where are we going??? Where is this place???\" Then came the light. There were several restaurants nestled in this little cute neighborhood. Upon entering, it looks like a super small restaurant with limited seating. The line fills the inside and curls out the door. A dreadlocked man comes around and hands menus to each person. After you get several minutes perusing the wursts and beers on the menu, he returns to get your drink order. You order your food, you pay, then you go down the hallway to the seating area. It's dark and there's a DJ and a bar and even security! It's like a club but more relaxed! I really liked the atmosphere. Twas very hip and laid back. You seat yourself and place your number on your table awaiting the arrival of your sausage.You can choose two toppings (of 4 toppings) to put on your dog. You can have caramelized onions, hot peppers, sweet peppers, and sauerkraut. They have original wursts and some exotic ones, including alligator (though they ran out of that when we were there sadly), rabbit, veal, buffalo, etc.  I ordered the mango and jalapeno topped with caramelized onions and hot peppers ($6.50). It was DELICIOUS! A perfect marriage between spicy and sweet. Yum yum. There are also several condiments you can use on your dog if you want the extra flavor: ketchup, mustard, honey mustard, whole grain (mustard), spicy brown (mustard). Whole grain was yummy! But the highlight of my meal was the Floris Apple Ale ($9). It was the best drink ever! It was sweet and just a great beverage to hydrate with.

But I'm all for trying exotic dishes that come from terrifying animals, so onward!...To a place about as big as a closet. There was seriously room for about 10 people in front of the counter and the sausage display. At first I thought it was a to-go only place, but then I saw the Hallway of Revelations and thought, \"Oh! THAT must be the rest of the closet.\" The bathrooms were off the hallway and at the end was, indeed, the tables to eat. There was a little sectioned-off area and a separate bar too. They were playing some music...it was hip.We ordered the rattlesnake and rabbit, the crocodile and pork, and fries (in the white truffle oil - don't you dare go and not get that) with a couple dips: chipotle aioli and peanut sauce. I really had no idea what to expect from rattlesnake and crocodile, but I was stoked! The crocodile and pork was just ok...a little hard to chew because of the skin of the sausage, and not too much flavor in my opinion. But the rattlesnake and rabbit was really good, more tender and flavorful! And the fries...holy potatoes, Batman, the fries. I have a weakness to fries...I have to restrain myself from ordering them at every place I go that serves them. And most of the time I fail. But these were among the best I've had. I don't know what the fries are like without the white truffle oil, but I don't care! That's not important, going back for more is!I recommend this place to anyone that likes sausages. Hell, even if you don't, go for the fries and the beer! They have a good selection of bottles and drafts. But you better get the white truffle oil! It's the second-best $2 you'll ever spend!

I think he's gonna be the new Decepticon in Transformers 3 or it's the name of something really painful a dominatrix finishes you off with....what!? sorry. The sausage looks amazing (that's what she said) and it's shamefully delicious...juicy, flavorful, spicy and I happily choke down every last inch of that wiener. (also what she said)yelp.com/biz_photos/KQBG… The fries are damn good too and the Bleu Cheese Bacon sauce....dipping awesomeness. The wife approves of the leftover cold fries as I sip another Optimator in the semi drunken comfort of my own home. Life is good.So, ladies AND gentlemen come on down and indulge those Freudian sausage fetishes and enjoy a big tasty wiener all up in your food hole. You'll be glad you did."},{"date":"2013-07-05","rating":"5.0","review":"The land of exotic hot dogs and glorious amounts of beer on tap!  If you're shy about sitting with strangers, like elbow to elbow, then you probably shouldn't come here or just take it togo because when it gets packed, it's time to buddy up!Not much more to say.

Not your typical types of dogs, this place has really tasty concoctions like rattlesnake, duck and bacon, alligator, and rabbit. As well as normal brats like chicken and apple, green chilies, and just normal pork and spices link. I got the duck and chicken/apple brat with sweet peppers. I wish I had gotten some sauerkraut to try, next time. The brats are amazing and I don't think you can go wrong. The atmosphere is great and the one problem I foresee having there is the choice to wear your skinny hipster jeans to fit in, or your normal pants so you can squeeze in more brats.

The ambiance is relaxing if you get there before its jam packed. The communal tables are pretty cool. I love the brown butcher paper table covers. Party time1. The rattlesnake and rabbit is the best, it's buttery and light. 2. The Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned with White Wine was way too herby. It tasted like a meatball. 3. The Filipino Maharlika was overseasoned. It had too much going on. 4. The Louisiana Hot Link is your traditional hotlink. You're over paying for something that resembles a boxed hotlink  from Food 4 Less. It's tasty, just pricey. 5. The Crocodile & Pork, Andouille is my second favorite. This is gooood! 6. The Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sage is a little starchy with the potato&bun combo. It has a good flavor though. My girl (vegan) ate it with a Rasputin (dark & heavy beer) and she was stuffed! 7. The fries are a must get. Pay the extra 2$ and get the truffle oil!!!!! P.s. the complimentary water is delicious.

The location is rather discreet - I'd have never given it a second look if I wasn't looking for it. I liked the ease of the whole \"order up front, eat in back\" deal. I'm the type of person who goes for the most unusual, high-priced items on a menu, so I ordered up an alligator & pork sausage, and one rattlesnake & rabbit. I'd typically drown my links in all the toppings they offer, but if I'm paying for exotic meats then, dammit, I want to taste them. So I opted for sweet peppers on one and spicy peppers on the other. Seating in back reminded me of a summer picnic - lengthy tables in the middle, smaller, more intimate offerings on the sides. My gf and I grabbed a coffin-shaped table near the front. There doesn't seem to be much order back there - the only time I saw anyone who worked there was when they dropped off food. The tables could've been cleaner, and it would be nice if the mustard bottles had a more reliant home than huddled in small groups on random tables. I enjoyed the cucumber water while waiting. Both my sausages were awesome. The rattlesnake was mild, with just a slight bite to it (no pun, seriously). The alligator stood out with a bolder flavor, although a few bites in and I realized it was filling me up more quickly than the first one did. I jettisoned the roll and ate it in all it's naked glory. We also got a small order of fries with BBQ dipping sauce. They were awesome. That double battered technique sure makes a helluva difference.

That is until the workers there pointed out that there was a large back section where we could/would eat. That back section was a tad dimly lit and had all these picnic style/family style wooden tables in the center of the room. There was also a bar there too as well as a door that led straight into the streets of L.A. Overall, I thought the interior was clean yet friendly. As for the food, it was great! I had the crocodile + pork sausage with grilled onions and a Aktien Zwick'l Kellerbier beer which came in this awesome tall ceramic mug that I totally wanted to take home. The sausage was juicy (that's what she said) and definitely had a different taste to it. I've never had crocodile before so I can't really say it was the best croc meat out there but it was still delicious nonetheless. As for the beer itself, it was a sort of light beer and therefore really easy to drink. It did have a nice flavor to it that I unfortunately am not able to articulate all that well what it was.They do have a water cooler/station near the cashiers as well as one in the back section so no real need to wait or ask for water.Now with that said, the meal was pretty pricey. I think I spent around $15 to $20 for everything. Nor was the sausage dog really that filling. Do note, however, that I am a big guy with a big stomach so yeah. Nonetheless, I felt I got my money's worth flavor wise. As for the employees here, they were friendly, helpful, and definitely knew what they were talking about. In fact, it was one of the guys working the register that recommended the great KellerBier to me. Overall, total fan of this place and definitely coming back when I can."},{"date":"2014-09-16","rating":"5.0","review":"AMAZING..... Only words that could describe this place. The sausages they have are one of a kind. Flavorful and delicious. The duck and bacon sausage is one if my favorite. And the only thing that would go good with awesome food is a great beer.

If it's your first time they'll help you pick the best sausage for you."},{"date":"2012-04-08","rating":"4.0","review":"Wurstkuche is one of those trendy bar/eateries that makes most of its business by word of mouth. There is usually a line out front on popular nights, but on a Wednesday night, it was an easy walk up. This place is deceiving at first, because Wurstkuche is located in a dark back road and through a garage entrance. Once you order your food, at the front then you pass through a long hallway to the large dining bar area in the back. The first thing that I usually notice about this place is the dim dim dim lighting. Drives me insane really, but whatever style moves this place.-=-Rabbit Dog-=- The Wurstkuche menu is categorized into how brave you are feeling. The rabbit dog appropriately seats itself in the brave category. It's actually a mixed sausage with veal, which I'm usually not a big fan of, but I did not get that gamy taste that I deteste. There was actually a good spice to the sausage enough so that I did not need to dump any type of sauce on top of it. Try this out with an open mind sometime and you'll see what I mean.-=-Houblon Chouffe Beer-=- There is an extensive beer menu at this place, which mostly focused on Belgium. The Houblon Chouffe was recommended to me as dark brew. I figure I needed something dark to go with my exotic dog. Had I been dying off the sausage gamy-ness, I would have been able to wash it down with a bitter beer. Didn't need any of that though because it all was delicious, down to the dog."},{"date":"2009-08-24","rating":"4.0","review":"What could be better than sausages, fries and good belgian & german beer for a nice sit-down Friday lunch?Wurstkuche is in an unassuming building. Heck, wouldn't have found it if they didn't have the sign over the open door.This is one of those order, pay, then sit down and wait for your food places. At the counter is the sausage display, with all the types they have and labels what is inside. I went for the duck and bacon sausage with sweet peppers and jalapeno peppers, and a glass of chimay white to go with it. I wanted a Leffe blonde, but they only had brune :(. Also split a large order of fries with my friends.In the back is the seating area. It is canteen-style with its long tables and benches- reminded me of Europe. There is a water tank by the bar and the water has a hint of cucumber- rather tasty and refreshing.So our food comes. The sausage looks delicious and is PACKED with sweet peppers and jalapenos (static.px.yelp.com/bphot…) . I bit into it and it is so juicy that it squirted out. The bread is so soft. I wish the peppers were stuffed into the sides of the roll and not on top of the sausage because they kept falling off when I was eating it. The sausage was tasty, but I couldn't really distinguish the taste of duck and/or bacon. Mostly because all I tasted were peppers.The fries were crunchy, and tasty, and not too greasy. We got the chipotle ketchup, tzatziki, and chipotle aioli (from my other friend). I liked the chipotle ketchup, the tzatziki was odd, and chipotle aioli was too creamy/mayo-y for me. Overall, the fries were better than at Pomme Frites in NYC, though PF definitely has more sauces.My friend also got the apple pie ice cream sandwich which I stole a bite out of (static.px.yelp.com/bphot…). It was pretty good and huge! Biting into it, the ice cream squashed out but didn't fall off or melt. Yum.They also had someone walking around, giving samples of some beer. My friend said that was the first time he's seen them do that before.I liked it. I'd definitely come back to try the other flavors, but without any toppings so I can taste the sausage. I hope they'll have Leffe Blonde too."},{"date":"2014-03-14","rating":"4.0","review":"Love this place.

Well no freaking duh, I don't mind paying extra, I just want my fries truffled. That rant aside, I day dream of their truffle fries constantly. The weenies are good, I got really excited my first visit and ordered 2. I can hardly even finish one.

My favorite sausage is the sun dried tomato mozzarella one. I've also tried the one with green chilies and cilantro, but I preferred the sun dried tomato. I can't bear to try another again! It's too delicious!The fries are also incredible. The best sauces are chipotle aioli, pesto mayo, sundried tomato mayo, and the bleu cheese one. All incredible. I'd recommend getting a large and splitting it with a friend so you can try more than one sauce for free! Plus it's more cost effective.I just recently decided to venture for a more exotic sausage and I tried the duck and bacon one. It was ok, but personally I preferred the flavor of the sundried tomato and mozzarella one. People around us kept ordering the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage so I might have to make that leap next time! It's adventurous but I've been to Wurstkuche at least 10 times at this point so I think it's time to ease into it and give it a try!If you like savory foods, cool and hip locations downtown, beer, or all of the above, you will truly enjoy this experience.

Parking was pretty tough, since it's near all the warehouses you have to find street parking. we got the duck jalapeno bacon sausage with grilled peppers, apple chicken spice sausage with grilled peppers, and Belgium fries with truffle oil along with curry ketchup and pesto aioli. The duck sausage was mediocre. It was a bit salty and there wasn't a strong duck, bacon, or duck flavor. I really liked the apple chicken spice sausage though. it wasn't dry and the casing snaps when you bite into it. The fries on the other hand were mediocre as well.

We tried a bunch of different sausages. None were really memorable but they were all in that generic \"good\" category. The fries are worth getting, especially with all the options of dipping sauces. For me this place is all about the interesting beer selections. I also like the industrial style look and feel of the place.

I actually even forgot about this place until it popped up on my checked-in \"Your review awaits...\" box.So when shedding out $20 on a meal based around a hot dog, I'm expecting greatness, unfortunately for me it wasn't.The exterior of the restaurant makes you rethink going in, then once you're inside the display glass in the front makes you rethink about eating. After you order in the front, you follow the hallway down to the back room and there is what looks like a small cafeteria covered in concrete, filled with lunch benches and a bar.I ordered the sun dried tomato and mozzarella (smoked chicken/turkey), Belgium fries with the white truffle oil, blue cheese walnut/bacon sauce and chipotle aioli sauce. To be fair, the hot dog was tasty but nothing memorable. However even though my fries were a bit over cooked, I couldn't stop eating them. I didn't finish the sausage but I did finish my fries and my friend's fries. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if the table I was eating on didn't have crap all over it. I wish I could have spent more time enjoying my meal instead of being busy making sure not to put my elbows into anything gross or having my backside rubbed or bumped by strangers.Sidenote: there's no soda. Sure they have their shmancy carbonated drinks in shmancy glass bottles with shmancy labels -- but fountain soda wouldn't kill you guys. I'm pretty sure they have Cocoa cola in Germany by now and I'm sure they wouldn't mind you carrying it in your restaurant. Not all of us can have a brewsky with our meals, though I'm sure it wouldn't have made much of a difference. And that \"ginger ale\" drink is garbage. It literally tastes like ginger + ale.

We parked on the street for free right next to the restaurant. As we walked up we saw a long ass line and were I felt kinda annoyed since waiting for food has never been my thing. However, I took one for team and sucked it up. Waited about 25 minutes to order and another 20 minutes for the food to be done.Here's what we got:Rattlesnake and rabbit sausage: AMAZING and sooo juicy. I loved it. For those of you wondering what the heck that tastes like.. well, chicken. Doesn't everything taste like chicken in some way? I got sauerkraut and spicy peppers for my toppings and they really balanced out the sausage. Yummy.Duck and bacon sausage: This one was a bit dry which was kinda disappointing since it sounded so juicy. It had a smoky flavor to it as well. Not sure I'd recommend this.Kielbasa: Yum, very tasty and one of the \"normal\" sausages. This one is good for those faint of heart and less adventurous.Rabbit and veal sausage: Tender and juicy as well. Tasted very similar to the rattlesnake and rabbit one. But, the RR one still ranks #1 in my book!Fries with truffle oil glaze: OMG. I'm not a fan of bigger cut fries, but these suckers were delish! I could totally taste the truffle oil too ($2 extra), but it's so worth it. We also got 4 dipping sauces to go with it. 2 chipotle aioli, 1 pesto mayo and 1 buttermilk ranch. The chipotle aioli was our favorite, good flavor with a kick. There is also a mustard stand where you can serve yourself. My favorite was the sweet mustard. So tasty with fries too!As far as drinks go, they have plenty of beer and sodas. I got a Pellegrino for myself and my dining companions got a vanilla cream soda (yum) and an orange soda (decent). In terms of price, not cheap! Our lunch was $56. The dipping sauces should be free instead of $0.75 each. Good food, decent seating and alright pricing.

I've only been to Wurstkuche a few times so far but I know will go back (although I might try to avoid weekend nights as it tends to get pretty busy). The menu is straight forward enough but has enough choices in the sausages and dips to keep it really interesting including 3 vegetarian sausage options (which elates the former vegetarian in me, however the current meat eater in me sticks to the meat options.) I can however highly encourage one to try the curry ketchup or the blue cheese and walnut bacon dips - I'm sure the other dipping sauces are pretty good too but I don't think I could go to Wurstkuche without ordering both of these. One other thing I enjoy is the beverage selection, especially since they serve chouffe (what I like to call \"gnome beer\" due the cute little illustration of a gnome on their label), and better yet, it comes in a Chouffe glass!"},{"date":"2011-07-21","rating":"5.0","review":"My goodness, does this place even need another review?

This place is perfection in perfection's finest form.I spent nearly $40 here and then went back for another sausage even though I already had buns spilling out of my ears.My girlfriend and I came here late on a Thursday night I believe. We shared the Bockwurst, Hot Italian, Filipino Marharlika, and the Duck & Bacon with a variety of toppings we thought would go well with the different flavor profiles of each sausage. We shared a groot (large) order of fries and tried the curry ketchup and chipotle aioli. To drink we had the Norwegian Früli, German Hopfen-Weisse, Nesbits peach soda, and sweet blossom elderflower soda.I don't know what else to say except that I can't wait to try every other sausage on the menu and different dipping sauces. I loved EVERYTHING. But will pass on the fancy sodas next time. I'd pick either beer or soda, but not both. It gets pricey when you order 5x as much food as you can actually eat.My favorites were the Bockwurst and Filipino (which was the sausage I went back for on the second round). Can I just say that I am Filipino, and Momma never made a sausge like that before!!! Also, I usually pass on ketchup - I like it, but to me it's not worth the extra calories or sodium slash I would just rather eat mayo or aioli. But the curry ketchup!!!! It was the perfect compliment to all of our sausages. The fries were also nice - not my hands-down favorite, but different and good with the wieners. Besides the food, the atmosphere of this place is phenomenal. We went here at night so we ate in the big cafeteria-like hall. It was packed with a DJ, full bar, and people cozying up at every butcher paper-covered table. It was fun and my girlfriend and I drew atop the tables while we waited.

We also ordered the Louisiana Hot Link, because we knew it would be good (and safe), and crocodile & pork, because we were feeling adventurous. We got them both with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. The sausages themselves seemed a bit overrated. The Louisiana Hot Link was nice and spicy, but the crocodile and pork was a bit too salty. In the end, they both just tasted like stronger flavored hot dogs. We also got fries with chipotle ketchup and blue cheese walnut & bacon dipping sauces.  The fries were terrific.

I have tried the rattlesnake...was pretty good. The duck was terrific as well....perfectly seasoned and juicy at the same time. One of my fav is the austin blues (perfect spice to it) as well as green chili and cilantro one (chicken and Turkey). The chicken with apricot was a little sweet for my taste. The fries are the best,  especially tasty with the various dipping sauces.  I love the chipotle ketchup, pesto mayo but the curry ketchup tastes weird to me.I have always found street parking nearby but I can imagine it being a hassle if you come closer to peak times.  The crowd starts buiding up around 7 pm and the line can be pretty long.  Overall, this is one my fav hangouts in downtown....go there, you won't regret it!"},{"date":"2014-07-11","rating":"4.0","review":"This place has a great selection of hot dogs from rattle snake to your generic/modified weiner, the fries i must say are one of the best, this place is alittle pricey tho, but the ambience and the set up is very nice"},{"date":"2014-12-28","rating":"4.0","review":"Delicious buffalo and also duck sausages.

I tend to compare my hot dog experiences to Top Dog in Berkeley, where you can get a delicious and juicy hot dog for $3 (I think that's the current price. It used to be $2.50 back in my college days). A somewhat tasty but DRY hot dog for $6.50 is unacceptable. The exotic meat sausages are mostly just that - exotic, and not much else to brag about.I wouldn't go out of my to eat here (especially with the poor parking situation) although it's a fun place to bring out-of-towners while showing off interesting parts of LA."},{"date":"2012-02-18","rating":"5.0","review":"Love, Love, Love this place!

They have regular brats and veggie sausages as well as fun speciality sausages such as snake :)  Last week I got the Santa Fe which is probably my favorite so far, its nice and spicy. I like to order the saugages with just carmelized onions. Definitely get a large order of their fries. Our favorite dips are the blue cheese, walnut and bacon as well as the chipotle ketchup-so yummy!

Came here straight off a flight so I was pretty hungry. So hungry I had two sausages. And you know, given that I'm trying to be a more conscientious Yelper, I thought it'd be good to try two for good measure! Anyway, I tried the Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned With White Wine and the Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapeno Peppers, with a (shared!) side of the white truffle oil glazed fries. The first sausage was surprisingly flavorful and I enjoyed every bite. The second one was just as buttery as promised and man did I love it. The truffle fries were also good but honestly, I don't remember eating that much since I was working on the two sausages.

Forgive me.I was not impressed by the sausages here. (Ducks to avoid being clobbered by a lengthy sausage link)I really like it here and I plan to return, but I thought I would love the sausages, and I just didn't.  Jim G. and I tried the Austin Blues (spicy, but not really), the Duck with Bacon and Jalapeno (hard to discern any of the flavors), and the Rabbit and Rattlesnake (it tasted lean, but didn't taste of much else).  The meat was of good quality, and I love the options provided.  Did we just order the wrong ones?  Is that where we went wrong? Or am I right, that the sausages taste very similarly?On the other hand, the fries are ridiculously good. I mean, we ordered two large sizes, good.  Thick, potato-y, double fried Belgian fries with Truffle Glaze. More please!! The dipping sauces are also some of the best things here! We enjoyed the Curry Ketchup, Chipotle Ketchup, and the Thai Peanut sauce. The beer selection is great, as are the speciality glasses for all the different types of beer.  The music is awesome (we were there on a Sunday for lunch, so it was low-key, but I loved hearing Passion Pit and Sleigh Bells!!) and the people watching is superb.  There is a great mix of uber hipsters who are just shy of annoying (although perhaps on a Fri or Sat night there would be more), families with their kids (very Euro-style), and on that particular day (Mother's Day), a lot of mothers being bought sausages and large steins of beer by their sons or husbands.  I will go back, but I will enjoy the beer and fries more than the sausage, I'm sure.

The exotic sausages are really hard to tell apart because of all the seasonings. I tried to snake/rabbit and the alligator. Alligator tastes like beef and snake just tastes like the toppings you choose. I liked the snake more though. Anyhow service wise they were good-almost annoying good. While in line, 4 different people came up to us to ask us if we needed any help. They also got my bf's beer wrong and forgot to give me my drink and I had to go back for it. Overrated? Yes.

(8 dollars for a rather small glass of beer)  That being said, the selection is great, and I think you are really paying for the ambiance.  It is definitely a hipster hangout, but not the kind of place that makes you feel unwelcome.  All the employees were really nice!

This is not my kind of place based on atmosphere, but the food is solid.I was here on a Wednesday Night @ 9:30pm, when the cool people in LA meet.What I liked:-Ordered the Bockwurst with Hot Peppers and Grilled Onions. I added Dijon Mustard to my hot dog. Okay, this is where it gets interesting. There's nothing really exemplary about this dog, but it was really good. The Bockwurst was well-cooked. It had a nice soft bite to it, and the bun was perfect for the sausage. -The bun was the best part. The best damn part. The thing was nice and soft, and had a small amount of sweetness from the rise. It was really really good.  It's what gave this its fourth star.-Fries were good. They were a little too thick for my taste, but they were cooked well. The dipping sauces were ok. We ordered the Bleu Cheese, walnut (muddle flavors), Sun Dried Tomato Mayo (muddled again), Curry Ketchup (good), and Thai Peanut (my favorite and I would order again). Two large orders were enough for three heavy eaters to finish, but we could have gone with just one.  Well, we should have gone with just one.What I didn't like:-I really did not like having to order multiple times. We got a first set of beers but passed on another run, because we didn't want to have to reopen the tab or run our card again. Ordering from one station, waiting for your food to come via fast food servers, and then having to repeat the process....damn.  I understand why they do it, but maybe I am just too damn suburban for this place.-Anywhere I have to yell to have a conversation is just getting old. Again, I have lived in the suburbs....which is my major problem. I am not hip enough (I believe I made several hipster references the night in question), young enough, not in the scene enough to go for a place like this. Does that make it a bad place? No. I would go here again, but I would NOT drive to LA just to eat here. Make sense? Does it really matter? I seriously doubt it.This place is really a 3.5 for me. I am going to four because I feel like I am less \"A-OK\" but not quite to \"Yay! I'm a Fan.\"  If there were a \"yay!\" I would be solid.

I'd have to pick the heffe over the pilsner but both went down well with the dog and fries. Will I come again? Sure. It's a chill place to sit and chat with friends.

Craft beers like something with strawberry."},{"date":"2012-12-29","rating":"3.0","review":"So I guess 4 stars accurately rate this place except I give it 3 stars due to bad parking, hype, and price.You've never have hot dogs like this in SoCal (or at least I havent).  Food is very flavorful, tasty, juicy, but too pricey.  Every time I've been, I've spent close to $50 for 2 hot dogs, fries, and some beers.  That's more expensive than most ball parks!  If I remember correctly, a hot dog is close to $8 or $9.  That's a little to steep for my pocket (for a hot dog).I can't take anything away from their hot dogs tho.  It is or may be one of the best hot dogs you will taste in your life.  I'm not going to pretend like I know much about hot dogs bc I dont.  To be honest, I dont even like hot dogs all that much.  The only times I eat hot dogs are: (1) at ball games (2) dirty dogs after a drunken night (3) when i'm extremely hungry and the hot dogs look really good at the gas station and (4) here."},{"date":"2013-07-14","rating":"4.0","review":"Wurstkuche, both the one in Venice and the one downtown, are winners!  They have done a great job of bringing a casual feel and blended it with gourmet.  The set up is very Oktoberfest-ish with community style benches whom you share with other wurst and beer lovers, you order your wurst (of which there are many, many, many:  A wurst for every palate!) from a cashier and you get your number and head to the seating area.  You can also order your beer there, but why??  You are going to get more beer, let's face it, so you might as well just head straight to the bartender.  So, you head to the seating area and you get the low DOWN on allllll that they have on tap and in bottles.  Amazing, amazing amazing beer selection and seriously the most friendly people you'll ever want to meet.  The patrons AND the servers and bartenders are friendly.  Just a nice vibe all the way around.  The wurst comes with whatever mustards and sauces you wish, there are a few to choose from.  Even if you aren't a pork eater, don't worry!  They have alligator, snake, rabbit (yeah, sorry, they have the cute furry creatures.  I did not touch that!)  And beer?  Sours, Saisons, Belgian Pales - - more European styles.  Just head down to one of them - - There's one in the east and one in the west, so getting to one should be a SNAP!    Cheers!!"},{"date":"2014-08-05","rating":"5.0","review":"Amazing place to casually eat fat boy food and drink hard-to-find Belgian (or German, if that's your thing) beers... Perfect Friday warm-up spot or Saturday / Sunday recovery spot. The sausages are great (best bun I've ever had - this is normally overlooked, but shouldn't be), and the fries are incredible. Don't be a cheap skate; add truffle oil. Also great music and friendly staff."},{"date":"2011-10-20","rating":"5.0","review":"This place really needs another cash register. The only reason the line goes out the door and takes forever is because they only have one register and one person taking orders.I love the food here. I've tried all the exotics so far and all off them are delicious. My favorite is the Rattlesnake with Rabbit. Very plump and juicy hot dogs. Fries are really good too and they have lots of different dipping sauces. I usually go with the Chipotle Aiole or the Curry Ketchup.The prices for the beers are kind of expensive, but they are worth a try since you can't find these imported Belgian and German beers in many other places. They have a great Oktoberfest beer at the moment that is out of this world.Paying almost $20 for a hot dog, fries, and a beer isn't something I like to do all the time, but when I do I know it will taste like heaven on earth."},{"date":"2013-03-17","rating":"1.0","review":"Duck?

Ordered the  Louisiana Hot Link and Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapeno Peppers and loved both of them. As good as the food is, though, the beer here is ACTUALLY NOT AWFUL. I preface this with the fact that I dislike most beer and am now seeing there is much more out there than Miller and what other people \"suggest\" is good. So far, I've had the LA Trappe and St. Bernardus. Both taste very good and come in large goblets, so you get more bang for your buck. Service: Staff is friendly and adequate enough. At the door they pass out menus and give recommendations to first timers. The bartender was prompt and didn't keep us waiting too long when we ordered drinks. Nothing above and beyond service wise, but nothing negative either.Atmosphere/People: Crowd is a mix of hipsters in small groups and other large groups of people who come together to just drink with their friends. Most are content to stay in their circle and chat (myself include) so not the best place to go if you're trying to reach out and inspire conversation with new people. Music has been on the better end most of the time with the DJ playing solid mixes that fill in the background noise pretty well."},{"date":"2013-05-17","rating":"3.0","review":"Total hipster weiner joint.  The seating area is large, with additional patio seating in the back.  I liked how there are several types of mustard to choose from to dress your sausage.  I had the rattlesnake + rabbit sausage.  It was meh and dry.  It's very loud and gets busy.  Come with friends and have a good time people watching."},{"date":"2012-12-17","rating":"5.0","review":"All I have to say is AMAZING! I have been eating at the downton location for many years now. I was here with an old friend and we split four hot dogs, fries and each had a beer to complete a manly meal. We ordered the alligator, snake, regular and the rabbit! All was awesome. I could barely walk out of the joint!!!!

I've been twice and the first time I got the Rabbit and white wine and the second time I got the rattlesnake. I was apprehensive of these choices but in the end I was happy I made them. I also like all the different sauces they offer and they're fries remind of the ones my mom used to make. The ambiance is great and it's a good place to bring kids which is good in my book and not very common in L.A."},{"date":"2012-04-10","rating":"5.0","review":"Heard about this place from many of my LA friends. However I've never heard them literally speak of it for I've only seen praises of this place thru tweets or Facebook posts. With that said, I had no idea to pronounce the name of this place before coming and these Yelp reviews weren't much help either.Finally got the chance to come here with a friend on a Wednesday night. The place was pretty crackin' but just the right amount. It seems we had beat the \"late night\" rush bc we got there around 8? And it wasn't as packed as it was about to be when we were leaving.Theres a guy at the door who takes beer orders so dont be too creeped out by the random man standing aloof. Anyway, you can get your beer while you wait in line, which I enjoyed. A little pre-game before the good stuff (thats what she said). However, if you're hungry and drink half your beer by the time you get to the front, you're more than likely to get a good buzz when approaching the cashier.I ordered the turkey sausage with jalapeño, bacon, grilled onions, sweet onions and I forget what else. Nothing too crazy, but it was still pretty good and flavorful.I also ordered the fries with the white truffle glaze which is seriously amazing. Different than most other fries, delicious to a tee. The cut of the fry was not your typical shoe string nor steak fry but rather something in between. I feel like the shape of it had something to do with how flavored it was. The flavor soaks throughout the fries, even on the inside, but not in an overwhelming greasy way. They were cooked perfectly. Not overdone or undercooked. Just right. Bet Goldilocks would enjoy it!The ambience is pretty chill which I also very much enjoyed. The night we came at least, it seemed like a lounge-y spot where people just come, drink beer and have a great but civil time. It wasn't all filled with these loud, obnoxious tweenies who just turned 21 and are all excited to order their first beer or something. Let's face it, those people are annoying. But, we were lucky to either have missed it when it came or this place is just not like that in general. The music choice was eh but I paid more to attention to the great conversations I was having than to care too much about how bad the music was.Water is available on the side at your convenience without having to order it or ask for it. This was a great move on their part. Saves time for us and saves hiring waiters/waitresses to refill your water every 10 minutes.Oh and one last thing that's important to note was that I thought this place was reasonably priced for what it is, with maybe the exception of the $8.00 truffle fries. Yea it was good but I dunno about $8 bucks good.Overall, I enjoyed the food, the service and the ambience which to me should always deserve five stars.Would I come back? I most definitely would.P.S. when I asked the semi-creepy guy in the front how to pronounce the name of the place he said it's: VURST-KOO-KAH."},{"date":"2014-03-31","rating":"3.0","review":"Wurstkuche probably has the funniest name for restaurant ever.  I learned it meant Bratwurst Kitchen in german. The sausage choices are bizarre  (rattlesnake and duck? ) but I usually just get the bratwurst which is great.

As I was getting to the restaurant I passed it on my way to find parking...there was a line! :o so I circled the block a couple times and got lucky with street parking. (Free since it was after 6pm) we got there about 715 & there was about 20 ppl in line waiting. It took us about 30 minutes to get to the front to order. The great thing is that there seemed to be a guy who may be the owners walking around and showing the menu and letting u know all the ins and outs before you're  stumped holding up the line to order when u finally get to the register. He gave our group of three a run down and education of the place. He later came out with samples and were delicious! I was very happy to see such happy people working the crowd and appreciative to be in the line talking and conversing. In line we decided to order some beer (not going to lie, it's a bit pricey for the 8oz or 12oz you may get) its good but idk, I wouldn't come here to order that many bc within a few orders you're already at about 50-60 bucks) I ordered the Austin sausage as well as my friend and the other ordered a classic. For 1 beer, 2 sausages and 1 order of large fries it came out to $37. My friend bought her own beer and we shared everything else, which was good bc it was a good amount of food. The fries are great (Belgian fries?) I'm guessing is double fried. They are known for their sauces, we got chipotle ketchup (couldn't tell the difference with regular ketchup) pesto mayo (yum!) chipotle aioli (awesome!) and curry ketchup (wow!). The messed up on my order the first time bc I ordered spicy peppers and carmelized onions - they put onions and sauerkraut. I told a guy that was working there and immediately got it changed when I showed the receipt. I think they literally took off the sauerkraut and added the spicy peppers....I tasted some sauerkraut in there. Oh well! :) After you order, you're supposed to walk down a hall and basically find a seat somewhere in their dining hall with long benches haha. It was a different experience to say the least. We squeezed at the end of a table and was grateful we found something. It's extremely loud and warm in there. I couldn't here my friends and with it being warm/stuffy in there I took a star away. It just isn't for me. You have to fetch your own water at the main room where you order your food or in the dining hall in the back by the exit. They have glasses in the shelf for self serve which is cool. A busboy walks around to get your plates and utensils when you're done, this man was sooo nice, you can tell he works hard. Then you see a body guard just staring out into the crowd. It put me off a couple times bc I'm guessing he's guarding an area for reservations or something? I felt like I was eating in prison with fancy food for a split second! But overall it's a new experience and I'm sure the ambience intent is 'COOL, HIPSTER' . I saw there is outdoor seating (darnit! I wish I knew) as I was leaving. The hype of this place is true bc it's new and fun. There's some kind of trend going in with double fried fries hahaha bc I've seen it a lot with restaurants I've checked out in north Hollywood and silver lake. The sauces are getting more attention I think bc you can literally put any flavored together and it'll taste great with those fries lol. Overall: my rating is true to how I felt. The dining is new and definitely different. Personally, it's not my style but I guess it works for folks who have been coming and keep coming back. I now know what to expect and excited to come back. There are lots of flavored to choose from! Look at a menu before u come on their website, haha you don't want to be THAT person that gets to the front and holds up the line going 'uhhhh....ummm...what about?.....uhhhh\" yeah, not cool hahaha. Great job Wurstkurche! :)"},{"date":"2011-08-16","rating":"4.0","review":"Damn I spent $25, beer, one of the exotic sausages & large fries.If you know me, I love fries, if you really know me, I REALLY LOVE crispy fries.

The chipotle mayo had a kick it to it.My cousins ordered the alligator + ??? and alligator meat is definitely tough.

I was extremely eager to try this place because it was part of the Yelp 2010 Top 10 L.A. restaurants (officialblog.yelp.com/20…). Ultimately, I would like to try them all but for now, two down eight to go! Went here last Tuesday night around 8:00 with my former roommates. Thankfully, there was no line at that time so Mark S and  I decided to grab a beer while we waited for Bei. With over 24 beers on tap, there is a beer for everyone. I had the Chimay ($8) while Mark had the St Bernadus. When Bei finally did arrive a small line had formed inside but was nothing to complain about. As we waited we pondered over what we were all gettingOur orders included;-Basics-($5.75)Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sage - apples, yukon gold potatoes &        rubbed sage w/ kraut and onion-Gourmet-($6.50)Chicken Apple & Spices - chunks of apple & specks of cinnamonAustin Blues-hot and spicy, tri-pepper & hardwood smoked pork w/       sweet peppers and onionsFilipino Marharlika - sweet pork , natural seasoning-Exotic- ($7.50)Alligator & Pork, Smoked Andouille Sausage - hickory smoked, thick       casing w/ sweet peppers and onionsDuck & Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers - juicy and packed with flavor2 Large orders of Belgium fries ($5.50 each), 1 with truffle oil ($1.50 extra)         Sauces: Chipotle Aioli, Chipotle Ketchup, Pesto Mayo, Curry                   Ketchup   ReviewVeggie was surprisingly flavorful but lacked the \"snap\" so was a tad            on the mushy side Chicken apple + cinnamon was refreshingly pleasant to the paletteAustin blues had a good balance of heat and sweetness, juicy and         savory Filipino was definitely the sweetest out of the five but without being         overpoweringAlligator, although i meant to get the rattlesnake, turned out to be a        good mistake. Great snap, spicy, sweet, a tad gamey but overall         delicious Sadly, didn't get to try the Duck & Bacon Fries were good but I expected a better crunch since they were doubled fried. They did maintain a fluffy and flavorful interior which was a great perk  However, the sauces IMO were the real stars to the dish. By far the best sauce was the Chipotle Aioli. It had just the right amount of heat to caress the palette without overbearing. I tried the truffle fries side by side with the ones without and found that the truffle glaze didn't add much to the dish. In fact, I found it to be off putting, like I was eating perfume. It might be worth a try but it's not for everyone. For those who want a quick read....Not a cheap eat so split an order of large fries with a friend...try the Chipotle AIoli, you will thank me. Skip the truffle oil glazeAny dog won't disappoint but out of the five, I would recommend the Austin Blues Overall ThoughtsWhile on the expensive side, it's expected with the quality you receive. For skeptics out there who see sausages as all the same, Wurstkuche might just change your mindP.S. This ain't no Pink's so those jaded by their experience at Pink's, I assure you this place is actually worth waiting/praising."},{"date":"2013-10-10","rating":"4.0","review":"I love the food here.  I could eat the Italian vegetarian one every day.  You can even buy sausages here raw to cook at home for 30%? less, which i have done a few times.  They have a wide (but expensive) beer collection.  I love the food.The only downside is the popularity.  The first time i came here was in 2010, and it would always be somewhat empty and not much of a wait.  Now, you go there on a Saturday after 12, forget it.  The line is way out the door and packed with \"cool\" kids.  I made the trip downtown a few times just to get my Italian fix and just to be disappointed and walk away because i didn't want to deal with the long wait.Other then that i love this place.  Now i just go every now and then, stock up on my raw sausages to take home and cook in my own free time.  All is good.One thing i always wondered though is why does the free water taste so weird?  Do you guys put something in it?  It's herby or something.  It tastes pretty bad.  Not digging it."},{"date":"2012-03-31","rating":"5.0","review":"This wonderful and modern German style brew and sausage house is the reason why I started my list, \"Going the Distance: Eateries Edition\".  Can't understand why anyone wouldn't want to know about this place.  The exotic sausages, vast selection of beers, intoxicating duck fat fries (Groot size of course), interesting soda options, and variety of sauces that will make you want to slap yo' mama!  Rattlesnake and rabbit is always my go to sausage.  Top that with carmelized onions, sweet peppers, slather on some curry ketchup, tzatkiki sauce, brown mustard....hell all the mustards... and a nice cold brew (dark of course) and you got yourself one satisfying meal to write home about.

Check out the menu on their website.The vibe of the eatery is pretty cool as you have a DJ playing some awesome tunes but it can be hard to hear your friends amongst the noise. The backless chairs and cafeteria seating is neat giving it a casual feel.I ordered the duck and bacon hot dog with onions and spicy peppers that gave it a kick.

I'm anxious to try the other vegetarian wieners. Appearance wise, the Vegetarian Italian looks the best, with its vibrant red color. The fries with the truffle glaze are addicting. I'm not sure if I'd be able to tell the difference without the glaze, but let's just say the extra $2 make them extra fancy. They are perfectly crisp and potato-y. I was on a diet of fries once, so trust me, I know great fries when I eat them. This place is perfect.

I got the Rattlesnake-Jalapeno sausage with hot peppers and caramelized onions. It was crispy, funky & all kinds of good. Plus, it's nice that later on in the day, when someone asks you, \"What'd you have for lunch?\" to answer, \"Rattlesnake, bro, what about you?\" The sausage was so good that I ordered seconds. This time, I got a duck/bacon sausage. And I'm telling you, this is a MUST. Meaty, juicy, \"hickory-y\" perfection. I also got fries with truffle glaze. These were some of the best fries I've had in LA. Ever. And the wafting smell of truffle oil is intoxicating from the moment the waitress nears your table. No good sausage is complete without a great beer. The Hopfen-Weisse did not disappoint.                    In summary, the sausages are better than any I found in Berlin.

Rattlesnake & Rabbit with caramelized onion and spicy pepper2. Duck & Bacon with caramelized onion and sweet pepper3. Mr. Q Cumber sodaBoth of the sausages I ordered were in the \"Exotic\" section which meant they were more expensive and well, as the name implies, exotic. I really liked the jalapeno inside the sausage, but they both tasted more or less like regular sausages. Honestly, I couldn't really tell that what I was eating was rattlesnake meat or duck meat, they all kinda tasted the same, which I guess might be a good thing considering you want to stick with something somewhat familiar. Otherwise, it was well cooked; it had a nice slightly crispy char to the skin of the sausage just the way I like it. The bun was decent as well, sort of like artisan bread. I very much appreciated that they didn't use buns like the ones you find in 12 packs sold in supermarkets. I would suggest skipping out on the cucumber drink and instead getting a beer or literally any other soda. For me, this one really missed the mark. It was like drinking carbonated cucumber juice with added sugar. Bleh! I would definitely come back another time. I'm very much looking forward to trying some of the other sausages (especially the veal and pork one; it's white and stands out in the display case) and maybe a beer.

When you first walk in there is a tiny counter to eat at and then there is another counter to order at. This small room fills up pretty fast. If you get more than 6 people, you will need a lubracant. Probably not a good term to use at a hot dog joint. Anyway, the menu has a ton of choices. I had the Duck, Bacon and Jalapeno dog with carmelized onions and sweet papers. Yum, yum. My wife had the Santa Fe.We also orderd the Belgian fries with the Bacon, Blue Cheese and Walnut dipping sauce(Ahhh...heaven) as well as the Sundried Tomatoe Mayo. The fries and the sauces were amazing. You cannot order a dog and not get the fries.Also, they have a really, really nice beer selection. What better thing to have with hot dogs and fries than beer, right? I was experiencing Farfegnuggen! We dined al fresco. For those of you who may not know what that means, we ate outside. On the other side of the building is a little patio area. It was nice and shady. Service wise, there were no major issues. The guy who took our order was a little rude. He didn't even look us in the eye(I hate that) and sort of handed us off to a girl who was a lot nicer. FYI-If you are going with kids, there is no kids menu. You really can't get just a run of the mill hot dog here. The girl at the counter reccomended the Polish dog, which my yougen seemed to enjoy. Also, once you place your order, you are given a large pliece of metal with a number on it. Yes, no kidding, a large piece of metal. If you are ever in the lil Tokyo area, check this joint out.

They've all been juicy and flavorful. But my favorites are the mango jalapeño chicken/turkey and the duck/bacon with jalapeño peppers. I definitely recommend those. Don't come here without ordering the fries. They are very good and even better with truffle oil. If you love dipping sauces, they have a bunch to choose from so go crazy! Chipotle aioli is my fav.

Oh man, makes you never want to go back to that watery American stuff.. cough cough BUD LIGHT cough cough MILLER'S. For $8-9 a pop, they aren't cheap, but it's definitely WORTH IT! HAHAOur sausage selections this time were much better than my last. I tried the Rabbit, Veal & Pork in White Wine which was DELICIOUS. Super light, juicy (unlike last time) and flavorful!! Carmelized onions are also a must. My friends tried the Austin Blues, Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno  & the Chicken & Apple, all which were a HIT. Granted we were starving but still, such a winning combo in my book. Don't forget to utilize one of the five mustards they provide! As always, the fries + dipping sauce= amazing. Curry Ketchup, Blu Cheese & Walnut& Bacon, Sundried Tomato Mayo, Chipotle Aioli= FABULOUS. In heaven... take me back to Belgium....There was a line of course, and there arent nearly enough tables/space to comfortably sit all patrons, but we managed to cram on a tiny table and it was alright. Luckily if you want more beer, there is a second bar in the back so you don't have to wait in the long-ass line in the front. All in all, Wurstkurche has definitely earned another star from me, and if the parking/line/seating situation expanded, it would get a 5! Also it's not cheap, everything adds up!"},{"date":"2014-01-31","rating":"5.0","review":"while im not a fan of hot dogs, this place kills it! their selection is amazing and every bite melts.

And why did I drive up here after work on a Tuesday night just to come here? Yap! True story... Tuesday night, April 5, 2011... my friend picked me up from work and we decided to try this place out... the drive wasn't too bad... I think it only took 1hr 45min or so.. but I'm not sure... if you know me, you know I always pass out in the car... I remember when Lara H. got her ROTD ( yelp.com/biz/wurstkuche-… ) on this joint and have wanted to try it ever since... and because of her review, I have no idea what the proper pronunciation of this place is... All I can think of is \"worst coochie\"... yah, blame Lara!  Anyways, so a few other Yelp friends reviewed this place and on Monday night, while having dinner at Island's, I was like, \"Dude, u ever heard of this place?\" Homey takes a look at it and says, \"F*ck it! I'm going tomorrow.. ain't got nothing else to do... \"  So, I was like, \"Sweet.. pick me up from work!\" And that's how we got here... Well, we parked and finally found the front door... it took us awhile cuz there weren't any clear signs on the side that we parked.  There was a line of about 15 - 20 people at about 8:45pm.  It probably took us about 15 minutes to get to the cashier to pay and order our food... which is all good cuz I didn't know what to get.  They had some exotic meats such as the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage... which a lot of the reviews mention.. but naw, I wasn't feeling that.. at least, not all by myself... so I opted out...Once we got to the cashier to place our order, I decided on getting the Duck & Bacon w/ Jalapeno Peppers and also the Mango Jalapeno sausage.  Both with grilled onions and spicy peppers ( yelp.com/biz_photos/KQBG… )  I ordered some Belgian fries ( yelp.com/biz_photos/KQBG… ) also with Pesto Mayo and Sweet and Sassy BBQ sauces ( yelp.com/biz_photos/KQBG… ).  Unfortunately, they didn't have any fountain sodas (BOOO!!!) so I got a peach soda in a bottle ( yelp.com/biz_photos/KQBG… ).  They gave me my order number and I headed to the back seating area which is down a long hallway.  It's pretty dim in there and the table set up is like a german beer garden.  They also had a few small tables available that will seat about 2-4 people.  Well, found an empty area to sit at one of the benches and patiently waited.  One cool thing about this beer garden table set up is that you can't really isolate yourselves and be antisocial.  We met a few first-timers to this restaurant and had a great conversation with Heidi and Kaya (Sorry if I misspelled your name?! or even got it completely wrong...) Anyways, the food came out... took about 10 minutes and enjoyed the meal... the Belgian fries were delish!!! and the Pesto mayo is tasty dipping sauce.  I wasn't too much a fan of the Duck/Bacon but it wasn't too bad... I really liked the Mango Jalapeno tho... and the spicy peppers and grilled onions were perfect!!!  ( yelp.com/biz_photos/KQBG… )Besides the wait, the service was awesome!!! Real friendly people that work here and they've got some genuine smiles on their faces...Oh, they have beers on draft, bottled, wines and dessert too... but I'm not much of a drinker so I didn't have any... although, I think if the San Diego peeps set up a UYE here, they'd have an awesome time! Well, I told some of my coworkers about this place and I described it to them as a gastropub... and they were like, \"What?\" Yah, I had no idea what that meant either... I figured they would since they like to go out for HH but nope... so, using my trusty smartphone, did a quick search and a gastropub is a place that serves high-end food and high-end beer... well, I definitely agree that this place does serve some good high-end food... cuz it is pretty pricey for a \"hot dog\"...I am definitely coming back... there's a few other flavors I'd like to try out... maybe even the Rattlesnake/Rabbit sausage... but only if 4 other people share it with me!"},{"date":"2013-04-02","rating":"4.0","review":"They have a lot of unique sausage choices.  I was more interested in the ice cream sandwich which was fantastic."},{"date":"2009-12-10","rating":"4.0","review":"It's simple.  Go to the front and order what you want.Take your number and head towards the back and seat yourself.Wait for the food to come to you.Then feast.I had the Mango jalapeno sausage (chicken and turkey) with sweet and spicy peppers for $6.75.  I think I could have done without so many spicy peppers, but it was still very tasty.  The four of us split the Groot Belgian fries ($5.50) with white truffle oil glaze (+$1.50).  I fricking LOVE truffle oil.  Curry ketchup was awesome.  The Bleu Cheese, walnut, and bacon dipping sauce was not so awesome.  Honestly, I could have had a Groot all by myself...Then we split the toasted apple pie sandwich, which was a bit hard but still delish."},{"date":"2011-07-26","rating":"4.0","review":"Came here a little after 4:30PM on a weekday with girlfriends and didn't have to wait that long to order.  There were maybe 4 people ahead of us, but the whole ordering process was quick and painless.  My friend and I shared one order of alligator & pork sausage plus the rattlesnake & rabbit with jalapeño peppers.  We also shared one bottle of their Elderflower soda, which was sweet and reminded us of Chinese cough medicine.  We tried other people's Mr. Q Cumber soda and THAT was super good.  I think I will get that flavor next time since it's so refreshing.  Overall cost came out to less than $20, which made it $10 per person.  Not that bad for a girls' night out!Overall, the atmosphere was very chill and fun.  There are a few long lunch table type of seating that seats at least 15 people on each side and some cozier tables that fit smaller parties of 2-4 people.  I like that they covered their lunch tables with butcher paper.Parking is pretty decent in this area since there are a lot of metered spots that are free after 4PM.  :)"},{"date":"2011-09-07","rating":"5.0","review":"The decor is really what you expect from a DTLA foodie joint!Expect to stand in line for a bit as there is usually a wait to get to the register...a menu is offered as you wait and once you get to the entrance the hostess will offer you a cold beverage(alcoholic or otherwise).My meal consisted of:--Manhattan Special Black Cherry Soda-4 stars, and i wish I had a bit more liquid.-Duck & Bacon sausage-5 stars the sausage was tasty and filling.

I'm sure Wurstkuche will get 5 stars from V.R,as this place is pretty much my husband's dream come true. I hate hot dogs and the thought of rattle snake anything make me want to puke, so I imagined going here to watch my husband eat and then leave to go somewhere for me, but it wasn't nearly that bad.My better half (although that is negotiable now that he ate rattlesnake), ordered the rattlesnake and rabbit, while I stood there with a \"nothing for me\" look on my face. The cashier didn't need confirmation as he completely knew what I was thinking.We sat in the to go area where I started reading reviews from fellow yelpers. I discovered that I may have something to try after all...namely the fries and beer. As Virak R. enjoyed his sausage (hehehe) I walked up to the cashier and said, \"I want beer and fries.\" he asked what kind of beer to which I replied, \"I normally enjoy a Guinness, give me the German Guinness\". I do believe I charmed the snake wrangler at this point....he cracked a smile and offered up a name that was unfamiliar and I enthusiastically agreed. He asked what dipping sauces I wanted to which I said \"completely up to you\". I think this man enjoys power....he cracked a bigger smile and said aoile and chipotle ketchup. The fries are big, crunchy and nommers. The Chipotle ketchup was a tad too spicy for me and the aoile (let's face it...it's mayo) made me feel like I was about to have a heart attack. I think I would have done some kind of BBQ sauce for next time. The beer was amazing. It was very expensive, but tall, cold and delicious.The decor in Wurstkuche is very German....harsh lighting, harsh people and harsh chairs.

But 2 factors deterred me from it. My gf Diane & I have been aching to try this place. She had been here a few months prior for some drinks w/ her cousin & had told me about it.She knew I'd love it for they had:1.) Bratwurst 2.) Imported beers (European)3.) An upbeat modern warehouse theme w/ communal tablesIt's located in downtown LA's arts district & can easily blend in w/ the surrounding warehouses. You may miss it, so look out for a Sheppard Fairey/Obey mural on top of the left side of the building if you're coming from the Traction Ave. way. We totally missed the Wurstkuche sign on the right side, which is where the main entrance was. Parking was an issue, I had to drive around 3 times to find parking. It was a Monday around noon w/ construction going on. How much more on a busy wkend? We finally scored on a closer spot but still had to walk about a block & a half. Finally we arrived! We came in thru the back door because of where we parked & we waited to be seated? The bartender asked us if we were lost, & happily told us to go around to the front to order haha. We get to the cashier & there was a grp. of guys ahead of us. So we looked @ the brats on display & started choosing what we wanted before ordering. There is no menu posted up, so given our first time, we were slightly confused & didn't know how to come about it. Our turn to order came & our tattoo'd cashier was already impatient w/ us from the get go. Diane ordered first & our cashier asked us what toppings we wanted? We looked around wondering what toppings? She grabs a menu in front of the cash register & hands it to us w/ a slight attitude. We felt rushed because of the vibe she gave us. I turned around & we were the only ones there, what was her hurry? After Diane ordered, it was my turn. I told her what I wanted & she interrupted me before I got to finish adding on to the rest of my order. I stopped & asked her what she said, & she says \"nevermind, I'll just let you do your own thing\". WTF? Sorry, it was pretty clear it was our first time. You have no menu on the wall, how can people even know what they want if everything listed is on a little paper menu next to the cash register? Instead of guiding us or even helping us w/ patience, the way an establishment is supposed to be run, she didn't. That pissed us off! We looked like idiots the way she was talking to us. Not cool! After ordering, we took our Chimay's & sat in the dining area. There are long communal tables & benches w/ smaller tables along the walls. Very cool, awesome bar set up too. Then our brats arrived! We both had the rattlesnake & rabbit w/ jalepeno peppers, 1 alligator & pork w/ smoked Andouille sausage, & 1 Filipino Maharlika (sweet pork w/ natural seasonings). All my brats had sauerkraut, while Diane's had sweet & spicy peppers. We also had an order of Belgian fries w/ a Chipotle aioli dipping sauce. Everything was f*cking fantastic. The buns the brats came in were soft & complimented the meats well. We loved the rattlesnake alot! The alligator was bitter & we weren't too crazy about it, but the Filipino Maharlika was incredible. Sweet & tasted like Filipino langanisa (sausage). Our total came to $53, so it's somewhat pricy but definately tasty. Everything besides our snappy cashier was great.

Are there any other restaurants you can find out there that serves rabbit or alligator meat sausages? Methinks not!It helps that the restaurant is also run by some friendly people. The owners will come by and ask how you are sometimes. The hip ambiance is also just right for groups of friends looking to enjoy sometime eating and chatting (and drinking). It really conveys the feeling of entering a small establishment only to walk in and see something much larger inside (check my pictures out).

As I've said countless times before, having spent some six years of my youth in Germany, since moving to the United States I'd all but given up on finding quality German food, with Whole Food's brats being the only legitimate means of satisfying my brat cravings. Well, watch out Whole Foods, because while Wurstkuche can't quite be classified as authentic German cuisine, this place is phenomenal, and could stand alone as an excellent restaurant, bar, or club.Star 1 - How was the service and atmosphere?The definition of unique, Wurstkuche shines even before you walk through the front door. Yes, it will be packed when you go regardless of the time, and yes, this could be quite unfortunate if it were raining outside, but in that this is LA, that's not really a legitimate concern. Long line got you down? Fear not, for at Wurstkuche you'll be brought a menu, a beer and likely free samples even before you reach the counter. Additionally, you'll be served with a smile that's backed with the knowledge of virtually every sausage and beer on the menu. Star Granted.Star 2 - How were the portions relative to the cost?Prepare yourselves for a true taste of Europe friends, because Wurstkuche doesn't mess around in the beer department. With 13 Belgian and 10 German beers on tap, you can get 250-500ml of authentic brew for often between $6 and $8 pre-tax. Take a look at these bad boys:yelp.com/biz_photos/KQBG…From there, the food is perfectly reasonable for what you get. Split into three categories (Classics for $5.75, Gourmet for $6.50 and Exotics for $7.50), the fresh sausages are complimented by a choice of two toppings and a plethora of mustard. Here's a glance:yelp.com/biz_photos/KQBG…Fortunately, the party doesn't stop there, with small ($3.50) and large ($5.50) portions of giant fries available with a host of dipping sauces:yelp.com/biz_photos/KQBG…Finally, as if all of this wasn't enough, you can grab a Toasted Apple Pie Ice Cream Sandwich on Oatmeal Raisin cookies for $4.50 to put a cap on what can be a truly mind-blowing dining experience:yelp.com/biz_photos/KQBG…Yes, at the end of the day you can easily spend $25 at Wurstkuche, but you know what? It would be $25 well spent. Star Granted.Stars 3/4 - How was the food?Sure, there are some good sausage options in Los Angeles, with Whole Foods close to the front of the pack in my opinion, but Wurstkuche is truly blowing everyone else out of the water. Would you ever find a Duck, Bacon and Jalapeno Sausage in Germany? Not a chance, but that didn't detract at all from the fact that this was one of the best sausages I've ever had. From there, the fries are truly inspirational, and their \"double dip\" quality, while poison for your arteries, are worth an early death. No, Wurstkuche isn't authentic European cuisine (outside of the beer, which very much is), but it's uniquely LA, and is among the best dining options I've found in the city. Dual Stars Granted.Star 5 - Would you eat it every day if you could?This isn't even a valid question at this point. Of course. Beer, Brats, Fries, Desserts, and a brilliant atmosphere to match. Wurstkuche is perfect. Star Granted."},{"date":"2013-01-23","rating":"2.0","review":"Rabbit Hot Dog. Um, No.Gator? No.Pheasant.

Since being introduced to this joint roughly 1 year ago, I have consumed the: bratwurst, hot italian, mango jalepeno, chicken apple & spices and the lousiana hot link, and of course the douple dipped fries.Be mindful that my experiences just skim the surface and do not really do this place justice as they have a large variety of sausages, including many exotics and vegetarian varieties that I have never tried. Check out the online menu.With that being said, the bratwurst is by far my favorite, chicken apple & spices earns second. The bratwurst casing has a pleasant crisp and texture to it, and the coriander and nutmeg spiced pork is juicy and incredibly flavorful. The bun that the sausages are housed in are lightly toasted and pair perfectly, being that they are not dense nor heavy and do not steal the sausages spotlight.The double dipped fries are like something I have never had. I am not a big fan of french fries but these are a must if you come here. My favorite dipping sauce is the blue cheese and walnut.Part of the experience at Wurstkuche is waiting in line, checking out the scene, socializing and having a Belgian or German beer, or beverage of choice prior to ordering. The line's end can end up to around 50 or so feet from the entrance, but please do not let this discourage or deter you. Yet, even in this scenario, your mouth-watering food is under an hour away from being delivered.

They had told us to come early to avoid the long line, so we only waited for approximately 15 minutes. This place is located in the artsy/hipster arts district in Little Tokyo. Having been to Little Tokyo several times, this was my first time in this cute little district. It reminded me a bit of the Mission District in San Francisco, with its painted murals and divey bars, mom and pop cafes, etc. Our friends told us about the exotic meats, as well as some of their favorite staples. My husband and I decided to go out on a limb and try the Rattlesnake + Rabbit and Pheasant with Herbs de Provence, as well as a Franziskaner beer. We didn't know how large the portions were, so we held off on the fries (big mistake!). The place was definitely poppin' on a Saturday night, set with a DJ and crowds of people. I enjoyed the family table setting and casual atmosphere. However, it did get too loud as the night went on, and I felt like I did some damage to my vocal chords from yelling just to talk to people sitting across from me. This didn't seem to be a problem for our 6 month old, as he fell soundly asleep in my husband's arms. A beer hall is probably not the best place to bring an infant, but we truck our little one everywhere we go.When we received our hot dogs, the portions were definitely smaller than we had anticipated. We tried each one and both of us preferred the Rattsnake + Rabbit over the Pheasant with Herbs de Provence. It seemed to have more flavor, though it didn't taste too far off from chicken (does everything exotic taste like chicken?!). It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad either. The bun was just ordinary, nothing special. I tried a few fries from our friends and they were definitely delicious, but we didn't want to wait in the now super long line just to order them. The Franziskaner was crisp and refreshing, I think I would go back just for beer and frites. Having paid $8 per dog, we expected a little more.

I decided to try out Wurstkuche, thinking that these dogs would convert me into a doggie kind of a person. ...not so much. For fancy meat in between two buns that tasted pretty average, it was a bit pricey. In that, had I ordered a level 2 dog (a gourmet weiner), fries, and a beer, it would have cost me $20. Not a problem if the hot dog (Mango Jalapeno) was all yum and no regrets. In this case, it was more regret and a little less yum. The toppings I chose (caramelized onions, spicy peppers) were just okay, nothing exotic and different. The fries, though, were delicious and the chipotle aioli dipping sauce = superb. I might return for the fries. And maybe a pricey beer. But definitely not for the doggies."},{"date":"2011-09-21","rating":"5.0","review":"For those who were wondering, \"Wurstküche\" does not mean \"the worst vag\" in German. Instead it means exotic sausage shop in Los Angeles. Here are the highlights of what I inserted into my mouth:Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno + Belgian FriesRattlesnake & Rabbit with JalapenoSurprisingly the rattlesnake was my favorite of what I tried. Maybe just because it's fun to say that I ate rattlesnake for lunch. While I won't say it tasted like chicken, I will say it was tasty. Who knew I would enjoy my first reptilian meat. (Is rattlesnake considered red or white meat? Or Blue for being cold-blooded? For the health conscious, rattlesnake meat is low in calorie and fat and high in protein. Watch for organic snake meat to hit Whole Foods soon if it hasn't already.) Oh, and I can't believe I forgot to mention the beer selection. They have great beers from Germany and Belgium! I only tried sips of it (as I had to get back to work), but they were delicious. And the service was friendly!

There are different types of sausages including, buffalo, duck, deer, and rattlesnake. For beers, they have a whole lot on tap here with a huge variety of Belgian and German beers. This place is pretty popular, so expect to wait in line and then scrounge to find a table. I've been here a couple times, and I'd say the hardest part is finding parking. Since it's sort of downtown/Japantown, there's basically street parking or lot parking like 5-10 minutes away. As far as food, my favorite would probably have to be the duck sausage. Very flavorful and moist, and if you're afraid of that gamey taste, it's definitely not apparent in the food here. The rattlesnake, however, is on the dry and tough side. I guess that's how snake meat is?Did I forget to say that they have awesome beer here? The selection is pretty damn awesome, and almost all are on tap. You might have trouble finding some spots to sit since it does get packed, but most of the time, there will be some seats at the bar or outside.

Luckily it wasn't that busy so we had no problem getting a place to sit. I was very surprised to see that they had more than just your plain boring hot dog.

Wurstkuche is located in Downtown LA in the Arts District and offers all a person really needs: a good variety of exotic & gourmet sausages, belgian fries, a wide range of beers on tap as well as bottled beers, wine, bottled sodas and ice cream sandwiches for dessert! :) Once you make your way up to the cashier out of that long nightclub-entrance-like line, you get to order either their classic sausages(bratwurst or veggie), Gourmet(for those of you who may not be adventurous enough to try the exotic animal sausages) and last but def not least the Exotic sausages! All sausage orders come with two topping options: Caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, spicy peppers. We got all of ours with the onions and spicy peppers.FOOD:Mango Jalapeno(Chicken & Turkey): Spicy and really flavorful! This combination topped with the onions and spicy peppers really gave this an extra special kick of flavor, definitely a MUST TRY! $6.50Rattlesnake/Rabbit & Japaneno: This was juicier, buttery and spicy! Not sure which I like better, it's a really close tie between these two, they're both unbelievably delicious! :)Belgian Fries with White Truffle Oil Glaze with Bleu Cheese Walnut & Bacon dipping sauce tasted like...I don't know..maybe HEAVEN?

I finally found someone adventurous to try it with me a couple weeks ago. This place is kinda hidden. We drove past this place a few times before just finding street parking nearby and walking towards the area. The area is cute - lots of small restaurants and then an empty parking lot with what looked like dumpster art and murals on the walls of surrounding buildings. We still didn't see a sign for this place. But there was unmarked door on the corner so we walked in. It turned out (we found out later) to be the back bar. We knew we were in right place because we saw hot dog shaped food but were a bit confused for a bit waiting for a hostess or something. Finally asked a bartender and they directed us through a long hallway to the front. The main entrance is actually more on Traction Ave (regardless of their official address). It's not a big area - one cashier in front of a giant case of raw sausages. The grill is right behind the cashier too. There was a condiment area and one small bar with stools in the back. Most people just enjoy their food at the back bar I guess. You order and pay in the front and then they give you a number for your table to know where to bring your food out to. It's not a very big outfit. But there seems to be lots of workers and it's very popular. I wanted to try the famed rattlesnake and rabbit but since I'm not a fan of spicy, I guess I'll wait till I can try a piece of someone else's before I can decide if I could handle a whole one. I still wanted to try one of their exotics so I ended up with the alligator and pork Andouille sausage. My friend was not quite adventurous had the Filipino Marharlika. And of course, we split the groot (large) Belgium fries with the sundried tomato mayo and the sweet & sassy bbq sauces. I know some people may be adverse to trying bizarre animals like alligator but I've had alligator before and alligator in a sausage just tasts like a sausage. This was smoky and strong but really good. I tried a bite of my friend's marharlika and it had a slight sweet pork flavor to it. I could eat a whole sausage of that. Oh I forgot that you could get two toppings on each and I picked the caramelized onions and sweet peppers. It was a perfect complement to any sausage. We barely noticed the variety of mustards on our table until another table started  Absolutely loved the fries - hot and Belgium-y. I picked the mayo so that was my fav sauce of the two and the BBQ had a bit of a kick to it.

Luckily as we were trying to find parking we ended up parking right in front of the restaurant. We went into the main entrance where u order your food and I thought to myself this must be the ToGo part of the place it was so tiny.

We walked around and noticed some large wooden doors with no sign above them and there it was the bar/seating area I had seen pictures of.

So don't worry if it's your first time going and you see this tiny little space where people are lined up to order there's a whole dinning space on the other side of the kitchen wall.

Louis beer that's hard to find at restaurants. I will be coming back next time I'm in the area."},{"date":"2013-12-18","rating":"4.0","review":"Awesome spot! Lamb sausages were so good. Quite an extensive beer selection or hop across the street to Angel City. Gotta try the belgian fries with all the sauces. Curry ketchup and spicy whole grain mustard were my favorites.

The rolls the sausages are served on are also delicious. On our last visit the line was a bit longer than usual and they came out to take our drink orders and brought us our drinks as we stood in line. Great customer service.

A manager type came over to our table to ask how we were. I spilled some of my drink, and the bartender there was more than happy to re-fill it.

Not complaining too much b/c I am grateful they even offer veggie sausages (and more than 1 kind!)1* for the acoustics.

My roommate used to work here and alleged that they do not make their own sausages. Whether that's true or not, I don't know, but if that's the case I'd say that docks them a star.

To help with the wait, a server takes drink orders while you wait, so naturally I got pretty buzzed while waiting because I had an empty stomach.Highlights:1) LOUISIANA HOT LINK - I'm a huge fan of spicy hot dogs and they certainly serve really amazing hot links with a good spicy kick. 2) RATTLESNAKE & RABBIT with JALAPENO PEPPERS - buttery as they described it with a mild spicy kick. There was a snap to the sausage when biting into it, which is what i like in a hot dog.3) DUCK & BACON with JALAPENO PEPPERS - meaty, juicy, with a little bit of grease, and a hint of spicyness. Amazing!4) BELGIAN FRIES - Amazing fries. must order with the mentioned dipping sauces below. I wish to try more when I come back.5) Dipping sauces - Chipotle Aioli, Chipotle Ketchup, curry ketchup.I think I ordered the Chouffe on draft and it was light and crisp.

My only grip about this place is its noise and darkness.  It is SO dark and SO loud.  I guess you have the option of sitting outside!  Parking around this area sucks but if you look, you'll eventually find something.  Don't get fooled into parking in the lot that says it's $3....it's actually $3 for like 15 minutes!  Grab a pie for dessert afterwards!"},{"date":"2011-10-09","rating":"5.0","review":"I've heard of this place from my sister and was downtown with some girlfriends so we decided to check this place out.I didn't get a chance to read the reviews so I was safe and ordered the Hot Italian.  I wish I tried something more daring but the Hot Italian was really good.  It was spicy but not mouth burning spicy.  Yummy.The fries are really good too!  I loved the dipping sauces.  My favorite sauce Chipotle Aoli.

We ask him how to pronounce the name and proceed to tell him that we think it's \"worst coochie\" while he literally has a cow! \"OH NO NO NO!\" He tries to tell us the correct pronunciation, but we just continue saying \"worst coochie\" and giggle.On to the sausage!!!!!!!!!! We tried:- the brat: tasty and juicy...just how I like it.- mango jalapeno: sweet with a little kick. was very tasty- rattlesnack and rabbit: this was my favorite! the flavor was good, buttery, and had a kick courtesy of the jalapeno.

A little char from the grill is nice on anything, but not that much black.  The duck/bacon/jalapeno just reminded me of spicy chorizo, nothing special.Service was questionable.  Took about 15 minutes to get our order, which was expected and not bad.  You order two sauces witih the large fries (they weren't that large).  We get ranch with ours, and only one, guess what, we didn't order ranch.  Eventually it was straightened out.  Blue cheese with bacon was excellent, sweet and sassy bqq was good but didn't go well with the fries.  I needed it for my charred and dry sausage.   You can also add truffle oil to your fries for $2, I saw no evidence it was put on ours, apparently it wasn't straightened out and we should have got a refund.  So we didn't get the large fries, truffle oil or dipping suace we ordered. Fail.  It's not that difficult when they're all clearly printed on the receipt.They had some nice Austrian brandy shots, which gives the two stars instead of one.  Damn, I fell for one of  their hipster tricks!  They have a decent selection of beers, but when I saw one of the bartenders give someone a goblet one third full of foam I was just glad we ordered with another bartender.   I'm not a bartender and I don't often drink beer, but when I do, even I can pour without that much foam.  Just another lame-o place overrated by hipsters because it's so incredibly cool.  This is everything that's wrong with yelp.  Forget the two stars, reading over how they screwed up our order I'm going back to one."},{"date":"2013-04-13","rating":"4.0","review":"You have to come here.

I'm a little intimidated by crowds/long lines/loudness so Wurstküche seemed kind of intense. Couldn't hear most of what my friends said all night, but it was still a fun time.I decided to be adventurous and go with the favorite of many people below- the rabbit/rattlesnake sausage. Bunnies are cute, but not cute enough for me not to eat them on occasion I guess. The sausage itself was really good and had an interesting taste. You get to pick two toppings so I tried it with saurkraut and grilled onions.. my sausage also came with some peppers for some reason. So tasty, a little bit spicy. My boyfriend and I decided to share some Belgian fries- wow, the large was so big but it was okay since all of our friends were digging in too. With a size large you get two dipping sauces so we got BBQ (kind of boring) and chipotle ketchup (mmm). My boyfriend had a keilbasa sausage and it tasted a lot like what we ate in Berlin. Wanted to try the curry ketchup (cause I remember seeing curry dogs advertised everywhere in Germany) but I'll have to get some next time. As for the drinks they have an awesome (but pricey) selection of sodas and alcoholic beverages. I swoon for Fentimen's but since I can have that at home I chose an apple beer instead. Wow, so good- I usually don't like beer very much at all but this one was super appley. At $8-$11 a beer here don't expect to get wasted.. or at least not for cheap. Our 2 meals came to over $40 with our drinks! Kind of expensive but worth it for an occasional splurge. Seating was beer hall shared table style. Like I said, the music was so loud and there were so many people you are only going to hear the person sitting next to you. Least favorite part of the night was trying to find a table to sit down out- this place is packed on a Friday night.

I was super excited to try it. When one of my friends suggested it for lunch one day, I hardly paused to reply \"YES!\". Parking is a little tough. As it is located right on Lincoln, parallel parking is a must. You might even have to walk a little. I thought it was pretty worth it, and I'm learning there are other locations. So you can take your pick. When you walk in, you see that it is counter ordering. They have 3 registers, only one takes cash. To the left they have a display case showing all of the different sausages.  They have some fun combinations like rattlesnake and chicken and apple. They also allow you to choose the toppings on the dogs. They also had a myriad of fancy sodas to choose from, but it didn't seem like too many regular ones. I guess they want this place to be an experience. Once you wind back around to the dining room (through a very murderous looking tunnel) they have picnic style dining tables with parchment paper tops and crayons! I enjoyed doodling on the tables as we waited for our food. They also included something like 4 different kinds of mustard on the ends of each table. Unfortunately I only tried the regular yellow.I ordered the chicken apple sausage and it was very tasty. It wasn't too dry, like you sometimes get with chicken, and it wasn't too sweet. It hit a good balance between the two, and made even better with a little mustard and the caramelized onions on top.  My friend got some sort of Wurst and seemed to really enjoy it. I also got the cucumber soda. Even though you wouldn't think a cucumber would be good in a sweet drink, it was really refreshing. They also feature a wall of beers, I guess a nod to the German name, though we didn't try any. We ended our meal with their signature apple cookie ice cream sandwich. It was soft and creamy and cinnamony. Very tasty.I would definitely go back.

I ordered the pesto mayo and some sort of sun-dried tomato thick spread, they were divine!!! There's a DJ spinning during lunch time as well. So many choices for beer, and a different dessert every time, but only 1 choice. There is street parking, it was easy to find a spot during the day, i dont know about later on in the night. Plenty of coffee shops around the block to explore. There was only one problem, their credit card receipt paper ran out and they apparently ran mine and my brother's credit cards twice.

Look no further. Wurstkuche has it. I went tame, and ordered the duck with bacon and jalapenos.

You can opt for 2 toppings from caramelized onions, sauerkraut, hot peppers, or sweet peppers. And then you're good to go! Granted the duck tasted pretty much like a sausage with a spicy kick from the jalapenos...eh. People were saying it tasted more gamey? It was good either way, but I for one could not tell the difference heh...oh my unsophisticated palate...The fries are also pretty tasty, especially with the wide variety of dipping sauces available. I think my favorites were the chipotle aioli and blue cheese with walnut and bacon. But yea, I think they had like 8-10 sauces you could choose from? Awesome.Finally, a wide selection of beers and even some wines to liven up your night, so enjoy! The one downer is that it's open seating and finding a place to settle down can be a challenge, especially if you have a larger group.

The wait was around 10 minutes so if you're popping in for a work lunch I'd suggest calling in but since I had the day off I was able to chill, sip on my Chamay and catch up with him. It's like Carl's jr. You get a number and someone brings it to you.My food was hot and the sausage with grilled onions and peppers was fresh and had bite and the little bit of resistance that I like. I had the sun dried tomato aioli whch was good, (the tarragon aioli was not so much) with my fries and they were tasty.Definitely will be back. Probably more in the day than in the night because I hate crowds."},{"date":"2014-07-01","rating":"5.0","review":"I love you, Wurstkuche!  The beer selection is swell, the veggie sausage is delightful and the staff is always very pleasant.  If only the line could vanish....but it's cool, I get it, yummers place is bound to gather a crowd."},{"date":"2013-07-10","rating":"5.0","review":"I have eaten at both LA locations, and simply put:-Good deal for your money-Wonderful, kind and helpful service-Fantastic food [The fries are the best!]-Great variety of delicious sausages and tasty beersDefinitely an important LA stop."},{"date":"2013-06-06","rating":"5.0","review":"Love this place!The food is amazing... they have so many beer choices the apple ale and fruilli are my favorite.

It's located right in Little Tokyo, so instantly I felt a connection. The outside has some nice art and the inside is dark and mysterious.When we first got there, there was a massive line...of course we went at night. When I saw all the sausages in their case, I didn't know what to do (PAUSE). I went for the most exotic meat I could find (PAUSE). When I looked at the alcohol menu, I went for the most alcoholic content I could find. Did I mention I also got that Duck Fries? Getting dranks and bomb food?! I'm in.Overall the place is dope, the food is dope, and you can have a really good time at that location. After the food and drinks, walk that shit off and go to the heart of Little Tokyo and drink some more and buy some Hello Kitty novelty shit.If you want to avoid lines, then go in the day time.

There is a $2 parking lot which I recommend unless you want to spend 30minutes looking for street parking. I went on a Saturday at 9pm and the line was long but if you're with friends talking the line goes by quickly. It also gives you a chance to meet friendly people. It's a small world, my friend ended up meeting a Miami alumni! I liked that once your waiting in line inside the restaurant they let you order your beer. I got the usual mango jalapeno sausage with caramelized onions and sweet peppers, fries with curry ketchup and ranch.We were able to find good seats, next to the dj and what I liked is that it wasn't too loud and we were still able to have a conversation.

First thing I noticed was the cleanliness of the facility, the organization of the ordering process second and naturally, the food itself.I had the Buffalo, Beef & Pork with Chipotle pepper Dog. I asked for  sauerKraut and caramelized onion as my 2 toppings. It was great. The chipotlle taste very subtle and beef and pork addition did not overpower or take away from the buffalo meat. The truffle oil dipped fries was another great find. Tried to make it myself and it was nowhere close to what I had. Bottom line? Need to go to Wurstkuche if you want truffle oil glazed fries.The seating is cafeteria style. Interesting as you watch what your seat mate orders and what their comments on food might be. Oh- the dipping sacues for the fries? Of the 4 we had, I like dthe chipotle aioli but truthfully, you didn't need the dippers for the truffle oil glazed fries. They are great as it is.Thanks Marko!"},{"date":"2011-09-16","rating":"3.0","review":"This place got overhyped for me. I was expecting the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage to taste more exotic, but it honestly just tasted like the kind of sausage you'd put on a pizza. The Kielbasa also tasted pretty ordinary, albeit with a more smoky taste. I had a bite of my friend's duck and it was okay - a little dry/dense. Of the three, I liked the snake best.The large Belgian fries was plenty for four people, and the chipotle dipping sauce for the Belgian fries was very tasty. I spread it on the sausages and it made them taste more interesting. But doesn't that defeat the purpose of coming to a sausage restaurant?  For the price, I expected more. At least now I can say I've tried rattlesnake!Really friendly service and there's a $3 parking lot across the street for patrons (good news for people who want to avoid the hassle of finding street parking!)."},{"date":"2011-02-01","rating":"4.0","review":"\"Hey! Where you at..?\"\"Oh, I'm in downtown L.A. stuffing my face with exotic sausages..\"\"Um.. TMI, dude..\"Yeah, that's typically how a conversation would go down when dining at Wurstkuche, the purveyor of exotic grilled sausages. I'll forever remember this place simply because of it's name. It's quite amusing when you pronounce it sans-accent. Give it a try. Let me give you a hint: First word is worst.. second word.. well, it's not PG enough to write here. ;-) Sorry, I digress. The sausages here are quite tasty. We were lucky enough to try the duck & bacon, and the rattlesnake & rabbit. The selection includes: Classics [bratwurst, bockwurst, hot italian, etc.], Gourmet [mango habanero, chicken apple, filipino marharlika], and Exotic [buffalo, duck, rabbit, rabbit, veal, alligator]. There are even a few vegetarian sausages! Along with that we had an order of belgian fries [read: double-dipped] and some beer (on tap!). For the dipping sauces, I'd recommend chipotle aioli, blue cheese walnut & bacon, and curry ketchup. The beer menu is as extensive as the food menu, with selections from Belgian, German, North American, and England.  The set-up goes like this: 1) Find parking. It can border on ridiculous 'round this neighborhood at certain hours. 2) Work your way to the entrance and stand in line.3) Peruse the menu and maybe consult a friendly staff member on which fine sausage, toppings, and complementary beer to choose. 4) Order your meal. A full meal should be: sausage, fries, beer. 5) Grab your number and make your way down the unassuming hallway to the dining area. And, depending on what hour of the day it is, scrounge for a seat. Note that there's outdoor seating as well. 6) Receive food. Grab the appropriate gourmet mustards. 7) Dig in. Voraciously. 8) Hobble & stumble your way out and enjoy the rest of your day/night.."},{"date":"2011-03-26","rating":"4.0","review":"After a really REALLY busy week which is only going to get busier next week, I went with a group of guys to this hipster hot dog hang-out. We wait in line to order - got two polish dogs, filipino dog, mango dog and another hot dog. We also got two orders of Belgian fries amongst the four of us. The food was good and it was quite flavorful. I liked how the bread was more a baguette than a hot dog bun. Made a difference! It was really busy on a Friday night but it came in waves. We sat in a corner by the entrance. We couldn't find any seats in the main dining hall though. That would've been cool. There wasn't any seating outside either. We came at prime time. The seating by the door is a bit of a squeeze and it gets crowded. One suggestion: rope off the line so it's orderly. That way, if people choose to eat by the entrance, or forced to eat by the entrance, there won't be people in the way. That way things are orderly and people can still stand indoors to get their order."},{"date":"2014-07-26","rating":"4.0","review":"Great staff and beer.  The line can be long, but its a great atmosphere once you get seated."},{"date":"2014-07-14","rating":"4.0","review":"Went here for a birthday.  Service was fast, liked the food and enjoyed the dj spinning away."},{"date":"2012-10-23","rating":"5.0","review":"It's pronounced Wurst-KOOSHA for all you coochie lovers out there.

We had plans to go ice skating (like in NYC) but when we finally got our act together it was way too late to do anything that could accidentally be described as exercise. Eh, where else could we go? China(town) for some grease? (Little) Tokyo for some candy? Nah. Instead we headed over to Germany for some sausages and beer. BIER!Wurstküche is in a sketchy area on the East side of Downtown. Parking in that area is bad enough, but add a bunch of coked out homeless dudes to the mix and the fight to find close parking becomes a very unfriendly competition. After circling the area a couple times I finally ventured out and found a cozy spot right next to a man's tent. Great. We got out, I tightened the bolts on my hubcaps, and we started the walk through Ghetto's ugly cousin; Gun-Shot Central.When we finally arrived at the entrance we stood in line behind thirty or so people and finally calmed our nerves. One of the staff walked to the back of the line and handed us all a menu. I skimmed down to the \"Exotics\" section, made up my mind on what to order, and began the forty minute wait in line. *sigh*Once we finally reached the door we gave the guy our drink order. BIER BIER BIER! The back of the menu is jam packed with beers from Germany and Belgium with names such as \"\"Koestritzer Schwarbier\" and \"Weihenstephan Dunkelweizen\". Eh... what? I ordered the Manhattan vanilla cream soda. Joy! One of my friends, however, forked over the dough for a small serving of Delirium Tremens. I gave it a taste and it was really good, but I'm not much of a beer enthusiast so I ended it with the one sip. Plus, I was pretty content with my soda.For the sausages I ordered the rattlesnake and rabbit (with jalapeno peppers). My friends ordered the Alligator and pork smoked Andouille and the Kielbasa (pork and beef with onions and spices). I tried a bite of each and they were all incredible. The rattlesnake had very soft and buttery meat with the slight kick of jalapenos to make you breathe fire. The alligator was smokey tasting with a more lean type of meat (I guess alligators are pretty solid. Who'da thought, right?). The Kielbasa was your typical Polish style sausage. This might be safe for the picky eaters out there, but for the men's men and daring women, the exotic section is where it's at. Plus, it's pretty cool telling people you've eaten rattlesnake before!After you order, the real fun beings. You walk down a long hallway to the main dining room. BOOM! Almost without warning the noise level jumps about fifty million percent. The live DJ blasting music and tipsy folks shouting over everyone else seem to almost make the floor and brick walls shake. There are a few private tables along the wall, but the real experience is the middle; three huge-ass \"cafeteria\" type tables. Everyone squishes together on the bench inches away from complete strangers (you're lucky if your whole party gets to sit together). The extremely packed benches mixed with people constantly walking in and out or just standing around gives you zero personal space. Oh well, we're all German for the night and that makes us all family! Relax, go with the flow, raise your mugs and have an amazing night, GERMAN style!PS.Bring mace or a taser for the walk to and from your car."},{"date":"2011-05-25","rating":"3.0","review":"I went here with my boss and my coworkers, and we waited in a line that went out the door so this made me even more excited for the meal. Unfortunately it was only okkk, nothing too amazing. I had the duck and bacon sausage. There was a kick to it which was nice but with the sauteed onions/sauerkraut/mustard I couldn't really taste duck...or bacon. Even when you try the sausage alone, there isn't a distinct flavor. We also got two orders of large fries. I'm not a huge fan of steak cut fries, but if you are...there ya go. The sauces that we tried...that I remember:-chipotle aioli....delicious-chipotle bbq.....eh-thai peanut (something like that)....it tasted more ginger-y than peanut-yIt can get loud in the eating area, so it isn't the ideal place for intimate heartfelt conversation. I think the place transforms into a club of sorts at night. I'm doowwwn to check that out. Hoppin' hot dog place by day...Hoppin' club by night??? If it were a little cheaper, I'd probably come back more often but I'll stick to my $1.50 Costco Polish Sausage for now. Maybe I'll be back to try the beer.

Everyone is completely welcoming, really knowledgeable and able to guide you very pleasantly along the process, a little joking a little flirty, the right group of people in line and it's already more fun than you expected, and you haven't eaten yet! The sausages range from vegetarian to rabbit to alligator, from mild to hot stuff. Coupled with ice cold beer in a frosted glass that also ranges from mild to wild,  by my definition that is stella to delirium tremens. Don't dare think you can walk away from the counter without an order of white truffle oil chips! Everything is fresh, flavorful and very authentic.You food it delivered to you quickly, each item is fresh and hot as there is nothing prepared in advance just waiting in steam table of some sort or another. Everything is made to order, fresh and to your liking. I think you get a choice of 2 toppings per sausage ( onions, peppers, pickles, a variety of condiments, etc are offered as toppings). I have always eaten more than I should and left uncomfortable, but not really regretting it because the food and the beer are really that good. There is nothing more than sausage, fries and beer, they may have a desert of some type, but the thought has never even   crossed my mind there. It is very casual, family style dining. Everything is priced fairly on its own, but a few high end beers added to that sausage and basket of fries and you are quickly approaching $30.00. You won't regret it and that you can count on!

My GF was too scared to venture over to the exotic section.*Duck & Bacon - You can smell the duck and bacon. Lots of flavor but tastes a bit heavy. Still good.*Lamb w/ Mediterranean Spices - 2nd favorite one. The sausage was moist and definitely had the mediterranean flavor to it.*Rattlesnake and Rabbit - And we have a winner! I thought this would be dry but it definitely wasnt. Very moist. Lots of flavor. Not sure how rattlesnack and rabbit should taste but it was damn good.FRIES:*Belgian Fries - So damn good! And the pesto mayo, freakin' amazing. Chipotle aioli was good too but pesto mayo wins hands down.BEER:*La Chouffe - Recommended by the cashier as his favorite.

In Santa Monica for a week, with my parents also visiting (sister's family out of town and we were house watching). Well, when the parents are around, it is best to plan some sightseeing so I finally put this place on the map. We got there just a bit after it opened and you walk in and order in this small front area and then walk down a hallway to the much larger seating area in the back, which has a nice, long wooden bar with a large collection of taps and a great selection of German Beers. We ordered a variety of grilled sausages, I had the duck and bacon sausage, and we also had an order of fries dusted with truffle oil and they come with various types of homemade sauces, like curry ketchup. The sausages were okay (next time I want to try rattlesnake and rabbit) and from from a food adventure perspective but the Belgian fries with the truffle oil, wow those were good! I also ordered a dark German wheat beer (a Dunkel), and my parents split an Elderflower soda. While we were eating this place really started to fill up so I know it is popular and it had a cool mix of people, probably because it is smack dab in the art district. Speaking of location, if you park near the restaurant it is still close enough to walk over and see Little Tokyo and visit the Japanese American museum. It was closed the day we were there but an excellent place to park, eat and walk it off by just checking out the surrounding area. If you are there later in the week, Thursday or Friday after 5 pm the beer hall at Angel Brewery should be open or you can have an early dinner at one of the many Japanese restaurants.Bottom line, as a visitor, would I go back again? You bet!"},{"date":"2014-04-24","rating":"4.0","review":"really good. tried a bite of my friends rattlesnake sausage!! although i was really hesitant at first, i can see it was good.very crowded but delish times 30.

Sausage!After back alley errands in the diamond district of downtown L.A. I pulled out my pink sticky, behold, the addresses to places I found on Yelp earlier today in San Diego. Here it was, a sausage place, I knew would impress Kim, beer, sausage, what more does a guy need?He always wants to go to Clifton's when he's in the diamond district. This all started from my suggestion to see Ray Bradbury speak at Comic Con on a panel, But I will put that information here for another review: LINK to REVIEW FOR CLIFTONS: yelp.com/biz/cliftons-ca…But today, I requested something new, and I knew it would be easier with sausage in my hand, or um plate.As the sun was about to set, we found directions using my brand new iPhone, we had mapping open, we had to pull into a spot a few times to get directions figured out, then we realized we'd landed in a 1 star neighborhoood, Skid Row baby, Skid Row. (What a great use of emphasis repeater, oh yeahhhhh)We were trying to get Traction, the avenue that is, then as we circled, looking for 5 star taste. We found the building, a little out of the zone. It was a simple brick wall. It had oddly painted sections of squares, probably painted out graffiti. We parked, and found the front door, inside was a small entrance, basic cement floors, and a simple refrigerated case displaying the gold. Approximately 22 flavors of real home made classic, gourmet and exotic sausages stared back at us.It was not yet busy, we were told, we were lucky to hit before the rush, we quickly ascertained directions as to how this was done. Kim picked a Gourmet and Exotic, while I just wanted one Gourmet. There are 3 sections, we picked, Gourmet:A) Mango Jalapeño - chicken & turkeyB) Filipino Marharlika - sweet pork , natural seasoningsExotic:C) Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned with White Wine - light and delicateWe were given a table number, rather large, bold in red, my favorite number, 27. We ordered the large fries and these dipping sauces were included: A) Curry KetchupB) Chipotle AioliKim ordered a beer from the large menu of beers, including German, Belgian, North American's on tap, and all of these were represented in bottle + England. He got the Old Rasputin - Russian imperial stout 9% ABV 16 oz, it was tasty but $7.25. I ordered the Manhattan Special Sarsaparilla Soda, $3.50. Both were tasty but pricey, but there were no IPA's.Our bill with all the sausages, fries, drinks, included dips, was $46.00 including tip.There was a long hallway, where after we ordered we followed the path back into a very large sunlit room. There was lots of wood installed on the walls, we did like the interior dark grey walls, and lots of cool music played from a laptop in the corner, everything I like from my iPod was played. If you are in San Diego it is much like El Take It Easy in Northpark.When our food arrived, we got to eating and enjoyed it. We absolutely loved the  22+ choices, amazing in fact but small portions however. Kim had mango jalapeno, he said it was not recommended. Then he had the \"Bunny\"  ham, venison which he liked better. He didn't like it as much as my Filipino pork sausage with spices and I added sauerkraut, it was our favorite for flavor. The sausages were not very big so Kim had to order 2, and was hungry for more afterward.I feel it was insane for value. It was clearly in a rough area so rent is cheap. The block we were on seemed cool and hip. But since Kim was hungry for 46$ we were disappointed in value.I also want to mention, they did have 3 kinds of vegetarian sausage: A) Vegetarian Italian - fennel, garlic, red peppers & eggplant B) Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sage - apples, yukon gold potatoes & rubbed sage C) Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle - chipotle, chille di arbol peppers, garlic, and onionsI liked this place a lot, I didn't like the prices. I probably will go back, but maybe order classics and have some water instead of a fancy soda ;)"},{"date":"2014-06-24","rating":"3.0","review":"Not a bad a spot if you can ever find it not busy.

But don't worry, most of the menu is rather tame.This place makes me wish sausages were healthy, because I would've ordered everything on the menu! But such is life, so I picked the Austin Blues. It's a pork link that was worth every minute of wait in line.Luckily, our line wasn't that long. It snaked around the inside and out the door. They came around the line and took drink orders, so I got the martzen (Octoberfest / amber). It cut through with the Austin's smokey goodness with sauerkraut and onions. The Belgian fries and the various dipping sauces alone would've been enough for me to keep coming back to this place. But with sauces like blue cheese and bacon? I became an addict.You first walk through the big wooden door with no signs.

The bun was good, but not as delicious as it could have been.Bleu Cheese Walnut and Bacon Dipping Sauce (3/5) - I didn't order fries so I didn't get to properly try the sauce. Instead I dipped my bratwurst in it, which was a sodium overload.

Worst-kutchy?Anyway, I got confused when I was trying to find this place. \"Oh, this must be it since there are so many people sitting outside...but where's the sign? where's the entrance?\"The entrance leads into a small area indoors for ordering. The inside had only a few seats...or so I thought. After we decided on getting a 1) Bratwurst with caramelized onions, 2) Kielbasa with caramelized Onions & sauerkraut, and3) Fentimans Dandelion & Burdock soda,we saw a server go into a long hallway. So we followed him. And we found plenty of indoor seating in the back! After picking a table in a nook, I thought it was too dark, so we went outside, where a homeless man yelled at us (and others) for change and food. All around us, I noticed how a great many men there were. Men who look like they go to gyms, lift weights, and like grilled meat.I liked the Kielbasa more, but don't think the sauerkraut went well with the caramelized onions. Next time, no sauerkraut!

Nah. The clerk was helpful (yet expedient) and definitely love the routinely \"pushed\" suggestions to go with your meal (fries, beer). Granted, I came for sausage, ate my sausage, enjoyed my sausage. It was simple, it was hot, and it tasted \"nom nom nom\" worthy. The bun...I could've done without, toasted or not, it didn't add anything to the sausage. Tried the bacon walnut blue cheese dipping sauce for kicks and can definitely see it's value with the fries. The sodium content between the sausage and sauce felt obscene but I still dipped a couple of times in my own gluttonous trance. Yeah...I didn't really like that pairing, but I still did it (FYI: ...that sauce goes better with the bread or fries).I'll be back here with friends who want a casual dining experience mid-day that offers a unique/specialized menu and tastes to challenge the taste buds.

It just didn't set off fireworks in my mouth.  The filipino sausage was sweet, but that was the overall impression.  Even though each sausage had different toppings, from sweet peppers, to spicy peppers, to onions, to sauerkraut, everything kind of tasted the same.  Again, not bad, but not as interesting as I was led to expect.Also, I couldn't discern any truffle flavor on the fries.  I did, however, love the chipotle dipping sauce."},{"date":"2014-06-21","rating":"5.0","review":"Great bier and INCREDIBLE wurst.

Like something is being grilled, somewhere. I arrive at Wurstkuche, as looked up at the name I was confused. Never heard about this place before, never seen this place. But all I can see was the line piled outside. First thing I did was go straight to the restroom, don't mind me. As I got out, line shortened and it moved quite fast.

Sadly, I went the safe route ordering the Buffalo Beef Pork Sausage with chipotle peppers. My brave friend went for the Rattle Snake and Rabbit Sausage with Jalapeño Peppers. That was not all we ordered. Had to go for the Large Belgium fries, came with two sauce selection and added on white truffle oil glaze..mmm it was amazing! I chose curry ketchup, which tasted like real curry and my friend chose the chipotle aoili.   As we got our number, I was confused to see this walkway. My friend and I decided to be adventurous and check it out. It lead us to an outside patio dining area with bar seating as well. Amazing atmosphere with cool modern decor. Every table had its own sauce selection of different types of mustard. As we got our food, I had to say, I stole a bite of the rattle snake and rabbit and it was delicious. The blend of spices and peppers with the sauerkraut added with their homemade honey mustard had unpredictable flavors. Apparently, mine wasn't as savory as my friends but had a nice spicy kick to it, although it was kinda dry for my taste. Loved the selection of mustard and I had fun making my own sauce plate. The Belgian fries were unbelievable! Semi thick fries. Crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. The white truffle oil glaze was no joke and was worth the 1.50.I left happy. Satisfied.

I later took a couple of swigs of the cucumber flavored water (which btw, tastes like the spa...blech) to clean the palate and truly taste the bunny and snake. I'm glad I did this toward the end becuz the wiener left an odd \"this is not chicken you are eating\" after taste (That's what she said! Badum ching!) The Groot sized Belgian fries are enough to share between two people. As many yelpers say, the chipotle aioli is delicious with a kick and the Bleu Cheese Walnut with Bacon is interesting with Bleu Cheese and Walnut chunks.

There's a DJ playing good house music into the place at the right volume level, and generally a fun vibe. Parking can be had for free if you're willing to drive down Traction St a bit where it makes a bend, past the giant weed shop and T.T.

We kept referring to it as \"worst cooch\" or \"worst coochie\" so I apologize in advance to the owners and staff, but it is pretty funny to think about going to \"worst cooch\" for some damn good weiners! Weiners and beer are an undeniable combination. The selection of meats here makes for an exciting visit with a variety ranging from well done classics (like hot links) to out of this world adventures (rattlesnake, rabbit, alligator). We had a party of 10, but half of the group was lagging, so the early five decided to find seating. Good thing we did- the seating area is first come, first served, and can cause anxiety to impatient folks like myself. This was really the most stressful part of our visit. I hate that awkward experience of standing around, trying to eye a soon to be vacant table, and then trying to stand close enough AND far enough so as to not pressure the folks currently seated there. Finally, after a few minutes of \"will they or won't they\" a group left and we swooped in on an entire bench, transitioning us to the next awkward experience of \"spread your shit around so people don't try to take our space.\"Thankfully, our friends didn't take too long and called from the line, allowing me to follow suit. The line went out the door, but moved quickly. To save time, I took all of the early folks' orders and presented a list, which the cashier happily took from me to spare me from reading it off to him. While we waited for our food, we ordered beers from the back bar and I must say that the selection is fantastic- we actually stayed a while after eating to put down a few extra rounds of beer. Anyway, we had the following:duck and bacon- bombastic. smoky, meaty, and juicy. tasted best with the onions and sweet peppers (someone had it with the sauerkraut, which was okay, too) sante fe turkey- also really good. the cheese flavor came through and it had great heat. This was my selection, which I really enjoyed because it had a great snap, but was really juicy on the inside. mango jalapeno- I'm weird about fruit in my savory dishes, but this was really nicely done. The mango smoothed out the heat and tang of the jalapeno. austin blues- this was good, but nothing extremely memorable lousiana hot link- really well done. good flavors and nice heat. filipino maharlika- I didn't taste this, but expected something like a langonisa. However, my friend said it was much less sweet than that. fries- 1 order with truffle oil and 1 order without. I will always ask for truffle oil. We inhaled that order. My favorite dips from this visit were:-blue cheese, walnut and bacon-curry ketchup-chipotle ketchup-chipotle aioli-ranch (always good!)WORD OF WARNING: the spicy peppers are actually spicy. I usually love hot peppers, but I was surprised by how hot these were. If you're a casual heat eater, you may want to pick a few peppers out. We had one issue where someone's order was wrong- the friend that wanted the filipino maharlika got the mango jalapeno instead. Given the long line, my sister asked someone what to do and they happily replaced the sausage without having us wait in line. He also let us keep the incorrect item and refused a tip. Very nice and very much appreciated!"},{"date":"2012-11-12","rating":"4.0","review":"Some of the most yummy, exotic, innovative, super delicious sausuges you will ever eat accompanied by a large variety of interesting beers!

Lots of different types of soda, beer, drinks. The rose petal soda was interesting.  Carbonated rose water.    Beers served with their matching cups. Lots of dipping sauces for the Belgian fries.  The fries are like thick and greasy and I like the greasy soggy kind.  The bacon dipping sauce was too much bacon thus salty.  The curry ketchup was good.  The ranch was your typical ranch, very creamy.  The bbq was good also.  A narrow alley way for a dining area.  Max 5 small round tables and 5 bar seats in a weird angular shaped room."},{"date":"2013-05-11","rating":"4.0","review":"First of all, who knows the proper pronunciation?

I was skeptical of the Rattlesnake & Rabbit w/ Jalapeno peppers, so it took a few visits to work up the courage to try it, but it was definitely bomb and on the spicy side! The fries are also pretty good, but I never finish them so you can probably split it with another person depending on how hungry you are.

I know -- an Angeleno who hates dogs? Tell me about it. I've heard it all.First things first.  #1. The eating area is loud. Contemporary house was playing throughout the entire room while I was there.  #2. If you're going with a group, have some people look for tables and 1 or 2 ordering the food. It gets difficult finding seats, so start early.Anyway, I can't even consider these delicious sausages anything near hot dogs. They're full of flavor and the toppings are the real deal. The Rattlesnake and Rabbit is so freaking juicy and perfectly complimented by the caramelized onions and spicy peppers, two optional toppings of 4. If you're a salty eater like me, you don't want to skip on the toppings as this specific sausage alone may be a bit bland on the palette.The fries, which are double dipped, are a real treat. They're thickly cut fries with a delicious golden batter on the outside, each fry covered in the right amount. A generously small side of fries comes with 1 dipping sauce, which was the chiptole ketchup for me. I love ketchup and this sauce does not disappoint. There are additional condiments, ketchup and deli-style mustard, provided on the tables in the seating areas.I'm not sure if this is a regular thing, or if it only happens when it gets busy, but a pretty lady was taking beverage orders while we waited in line and these were served to us promptly while we waited -- in line. Takes the pain off having to wait awhile. After you order, you walk down the dark hallway that leads you into the neighborhood of tables available for open seating. As mentioned above, grabbing seats may take awhile, so take the advice provided.

With a deli counter with the different types of sausages that you can see with little signs of what they're made of. Their menu is quite extensive. Their sausages are served on a baked roll and you have the choice of picking two toppings from Caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, and spicy peppers. They're organized by classics (bratwurst, bockwurst, and types of vegetarians), gourmets, and exotics.  The exotics are made from exotic types of meats such as buffalo, duck, rabbit, veal, alligator and even rattlesnake.  They have Belgian Fries with a variety of dipping sauces and so many types of beers. But once you order they give you a number and you walk back to the area where you eat. Now this area is huge and reminds me of a cafeteria.

If anyone wants to argue that higher alcohol content creates higher calories, then they can tell it to someone who isn't drowning in denial. You know I'm going for the Konings every time.b) I once told the owner that I really wished I could watch a Yankees game while tapping out their kegs and he told me that they purposely didn't include any to offer a genuinely social environment. I like that.c) Women prefer variety in the sausages they take in. They like them brown, white, yellow, rattlesnake, chicken, rabbit...this place offers all of that and more. They are bulging, salty and manage to obtain both soft and hard properties while sliding into one's mouth.

Two hotdogs, an order of Belgian fries and two beers ran us $45. Having said that, this is a weeny lover's delight. The line on a Sat night was 30 mins long. Order at the counter, pay and they bring you your dog. The menu is only hot dogs and beers so be prepared. And no beef hot dogs. Oink is the majority of dogs on the menu with some Chicken and Turkey. All dogs except Veggie have pork casings so that was a turn off. Frankly, this place has some flair to it. They have English, German and Belgian beer, so that's a plus. They even have an exotic rattle snake and rabbit hot dog. But absence of an all beef dog, coupled with high prices and pork casings means I will not be going there again. If you don't mind eating pig, and spending a small fortune on what is usually considered fast food, this place is for you."},{"date":"2010-10-22","rating":"4.0","review":"I finally tried this place after everyone kept recommending it! We parked on the street, went inside and ordered our food, and sat down with our numbers in the dining hall. (Plenty of seating!)I tried the mango jalepeno chicken sausage, which came with 2 toppings of my choice (sweet peppers and sauerkraut). It was good! But it wasn't super amazing. For some reason, I just thought of Top Dog by Berkeley (NorCal), which was just as good and a lot cheaper.But Wurstkuche does specialize in exotic sausages, which I didn't get to try this time, so I guess if you come, you should come for that! I also tried some their Belgian fries, which were yummy. They came with a sauce of your choice (or 2 if you order large). The curry ketchup was interesting! As was the sundried tomato mayo. We also tried the thai peanut, but I don't recommend that because it doesn't go well with the fries at all!The beers are supposedly really good too, so give them a try with your dogs!"},{"date":"2014-06-26","rating":"4.0","review":"Nice big, juicy weeners."},{"date":"2014-02-27","rating":"4.0","review":"Went here for hubby's birthday.

I had crocodile back in New Orleans and it was not nearly as good as this was. The textures and flavors were amazing. They also don't over do it on toppings like some places.

Upon my first visit, I have to admit that I was really nervous about trying their rattlesnake sausage. You can imagine my surprise at how freakin' awesome it was, when I finally womaned up and put in my order.  The only downside is that since this is a popular place, it tends to get crowded and the lines can be long. My advice is to get there early and save a table for you and your peeps.

But during a trip to Little Tokyo, she said there was a \"hot dog\" place she went to with a girlfriend she thought I'd like. The \"hot dog\" place turned out to be this Wurstuche!Just to be clear, they serve sausages not hot dogs. NOT HOT DOGS. I like hot dogs but sometimes you gotta eat a Bratwurst with a little sauerkraut and spicy mustard!We went on a Sunday night (7-ish) and the place was pretty busy. Confused, we entered through the back and walked all the way to the front just before the next wave of customers strolled in. The area where you place your order is very small and gets congested very fast. Still, we moved through the line pretty quickly. They have a display case at the front counter so you can see the varieties of sausage they have along with some soft drinks and other items. We ordered the Rattle Snake & Rabbit Sausage (w/sweet peppers & caramelized onions ) along with the Buffalo, Beef, & Pork Sausage (w/sauerkruat & caramelized onions) and added double dipped fries for good measure. We cut both sausages in half and shared. The misses drank water and I had water and a Duvel Special. After we ordered, we quickly searched for a table. We weren't in the mood for the communal seating (which is a trend now I guess) inside, so we found a table outside in the cool night air with a decent view of the downtown skyline. There were a few transients who walked by but no one bothered us. A couple patrol cars cruised by as well... fyi.Service was pretty fast and courteous in bringing us our food and telling us where to get napkins, silver ware (no plastic sporks here), and water.  When you order is also when you tip the staff, btw.Surprisingly, we both agreed, the Rattlesnake/Rabbit sausage was our favorite. The Buffalo, Beef, and Pork sausage was no slouch by any means BUT the former was just juicier and more flavorful. I've had rabbit and buffalo but never Rattlesnake. It was pretty good.We had a nice time and would like return to a Wurstkuche (maybe in Venice?) to try the Crocodile and Pheasant sausages.

The line moved fast and you can order and sip your beer in line, so it was all good. I was confused because to me walking into the dining room thingy, the little ordery line was in a little nook off the dining room. (For all I know that's the main entrance, I dunno!) Once I got that figured out, all was well. You can order beer at the bar. Disclaimer: I don't eat meat. I got the italian veggie sausage with caramelized onions and sauerkraut. It was ever so good! I appreciate when much-loved meaty meat places serve a veg option for when my friends invite me to bday lunch. (Even better when the veg option is delicious, which mine was!)

This is handmade and it was sooo delicious. The apple ice cream tasted like you were eating an apple pie flavor ice cream and the cookies were just plain good.

Some of my favorites are the rabbit and rattlesnake, mango jalapeño, and the Austin blues. Definitely get the fries with that. You get either 1-2 dipping sauces depending on what size you get, and my favorite is the walnut bacon blue cheese sauce followed closely by the sun-dried tomato mayo. They have curry ketchup, but it tastes how it sounds: ketchup mixed with curry powder. They have a pretty big craft beer selection too. They used to have a big das boot too, but they don't offer that anymore. Not sure what happened to that.

He came back with a rattle snake, rabbit, and jalepeno sausage. Sounds funky but tastes so good.  Don't forget the fries. Perfectly cooked and crisp. The dipping sauces are no joke either.

The sausages are disappointing. It's hard to taste the alligator in the alligator & pork sausage ($7.50) and the vegetarian Italian sausage ($5.50) is dry, but has good flavor. There is also a bun to sausage ratio issue. They should either get smaller buns or larger sausages.

The different mustards are a treat to try. Hint, sit next to a selection of mustard and try it on your brat.I'm a potato fanatic... so... Their pomme frites were a disappointment. Their pomme frittes come out looking dark and not crispy; although, the center is like mash potato, it taste infused with a lot of grease. Pomme frites are a double fry method to first cook at a lower temp; then a high temp \"crisp'ing\" just before serving.All in all, it's only okay.

The staff was very friendly and happy to explain all the different varieties offered. We purchased a bunch of uncooked sausage to grill at the game. Now that this place has gained so much recognition the prices have gone up some, and it's almost impossible to find a time of day where a line out the door doesn't exist. Needless to say, this place is very popular.

I ordered the rattlesnake & rabbit with jalapeños and fries with truffle and the chipotle aioli dip. Was super excited to try the food especially with the awesome selections of exotic meat. I mean, where else can u get rattlesnake!? So i bit into it and it was....meh. I think overhyped. Honestly, it just tasted like a hotdog. Haha.

Although, it did set me back $9 dollars.  The cool thing about this bar/restaurant is that you can try any before you purchase it, so you know what you are getting yourself into. The bar area is set up as long tables.  You can sit with friends and easily meet others (potentially new friends right?).  It looks like a cleaner and smaller Hoffbrahouse in Germany.  A DJ plays tunes Thursday-Saturday nights but I am not sure why.  This is not a dance party, this is a place to shmooze.  This place is found in a rather dead area of downtown.  There is nothing around it.  You can easily find parking which is wonderful.

The outside of the building looks pretty worn out and shabby too...like a warehouse haha but the inside is nicer. One thing I didn't quite like though was since it's those long wooden benches...like the ones at the park...you have to share seating with other people.

It just isn't what I'm there for and doesn't seem house-made or particularly special in any way.

This is where the bar is located!  So get your drinks here in the back/front room!  Cool long sharing tables are available in the middle of the seating area.  If you prefer small tables, they've got some interested coffin like tables you can seat yourself on the sides of the dining room!  They also have an outdoor seating area which was packed since the sun was out during our visit!  But there should be ample seating available!So hows  the food?  Pretty decent!  The sausages were decent size (I can always use more food but it should be enough for normal human standards...  =P)  The Filipino Maharlika was flavorful, slightly sweet, and complemented perfectly with sweet peppers...The rattlesnake and rabbit was delicious too... but the jalapeno pepper didn't do much to it.... but the actual sausage was pretty yummy nevertheless...Oh btw... when you order, you will have the options for several different toppings to go with your sausages....saurkraut, peppers, etc...You also have the option to put various tradition condiments on top as you wish... just grab the condiment squeezer when you see it on the dining tables.Didn't try the beers here even though that should one of the focus when you come here... not really a beer drinker myself....sorry yelpers...Service:  Cashier was nice and friendly and was very excited to explain the sausage flavors to us!  The cooks on the grills were smiling and cool too!Verdict?This is one pretty cool and trendy eater here in LA and I definitely would visit here again... parking may potentially be a problem so hopefully you will be lucky like me to score an awesome spot!"},{"date":"2014-03-04","rating":"5.0","review":"If you're lookin for a little excitement in your life, looking for something exotic, then this is ur kinda place.

European beers have such a smooth and simultaneously bold flavor compared to American IPAs. Even their witbier was really delicious according to my friends. And as for the sausages - delicious. As mentioned previously, I'm not a big sausage fanatic (something about phallic objects just don't get my appetite too revved sometimes), but I loved mine. I got the Mango Jalapeno (Chicken & Turkey) topped with caramelized onions and sauerkraut. My partner in crime got the duck and bacon with jalapeno peppers topped with onions and spicy peppers. Needless to say, both of them were gone! And the extra $2 for the fries does make a difference (thanks for the suggestion, Bullet) because having 4 sauces was perfect for our intimate party of 4. Hands down, I really dug the bleu cheese&bacon dipping sauce, the chipotle aioli, and the two mayo sauces. My group, which recently came back from a 2-3 week excursion in Europe, regaled me with stories about their trip and the amount of authenticity Wurstkuche retains in terms of European service style/quality (especially the fries!). Keep on keeping on, Wurstkuche! I will be back. :DSide note/edit on the parking&ambiance:Parking: Going to be a little difficult to find street parking because there is no dedicated parking lot. FYIAmbiance: Love that hipster, too loud to hear anyone besides your group conversation, semi-dimly lit scene. Personal preference I guess."},{"date":"2013-12-11","rating":"4.0","review":"$40 for two hot dogs, two beers and an order of fries. And it's worth it!  The food was great and the beer was better.

The beers were great, but I found the fries to be soggy. And although the Thai peanut sauce may sound good in theory, it actually doesn't pair well with fries at all.

All beers are amazing too!"},{"date":"2011-05-15","rating":"5.0","review":"You come here if you're feeling different. It's your Belgian beer and exotic sausage place, not your usual coke and hamburger joint. Parking: Since you're in Downtown (nearby Little Tokyo), street parking is a bit of a pain so you have to go around looking for it.Venue: After you park, you can easily miss the signature red/yellow wooden doors so as you walk on the sidewalk keep your eye out for it. It almost feels like you're in an area with a lot of hole-in-the-walls. Atmosphere: Definitely a place for social gathering and not an intimate conversation for two. I liked how as it got late (9 pm?) it began converting to a bar -- if you dig yuppie crowds that is ya know? But hey, there's trendy people around that serve as eye candy if your taste buds are still not satisfied after a big piece of meat hahFood: The rattlesnake/rabbit sausage was really buttery and good so I would recommend that first out of the exotic sausages. The buffalo and alligator ones were okay. I forgot which one was spicy, but I felt the spice drowned out the true flavor. The Belgian fries were just okay, nothing to rave about, but nice to munch on with the beerBeer: The Kwak was recommended to me as a \"medium\" beer if you don't want something too light or heavy. It comes with it's own portable beer stand since the glass is oddly shaped. My problem with this beer is that I felt there wasn't enough and I don't think it's because I'm an alcoholic. 5 Star Review: I don't know of any place that is similar to this establishment so kudos to the USC alum (entrepreneur program) who began this restaurant -- it's a fresh idea. It's nice to have a different style of food around since it adds another dining option in LA's already plentiful dining locations."},{"date":"2013-06-28","rating":"4.0","review":"Great Place to hang out with an awesome selection of Beers.The food is just as good and the combination of the picnic bench table seating with the DJ makes for a great opportunity strike a conversation with ppl next to or in front of you and your party.Pricing is not too bad either for the type of beers they carry.

We sometimes come here for lunch from work and street or meter parking is usually fairly easy to find. The sad part about coming here for lunch from work is that we can't drink beer and I do really enjoy the nice variety of beers here. I always go for the exotic sausages (rabbit, veal and pork with white wine? Yes please!) and fries; usually we split a large order of Belgian fries between two but we probably eat more than your average bear.

The prices are very reasonable--and when compared to the quality of food, should be considered a bargain. The sausages are amazing. Some are delicate, some are not. There are a range of flavors--some more buttery, others more gamey, more sweet, etc. The rattlesnake/rabbit sausage blew my mind. I wasn't expecting it to taste like pate! Don't come here thinking you are going to eat only one. Trust me you won't be able to resist. Order at least 2 ahead of time--the format of the restaurant is such that you have to wait in line AGAIN to get more sausages. I wanted the second, despite eating huge amounts of meat for lunch earlier. The wait is kind of long, so you should save yourself the trouble and order more early.Their fries are also delicious.As for length, my friend from Germany asked are they \"Baseball size\" or \"European sized\" and they are European sized--meaning they are not longer than the bun but they are somewhat fatter. I also had their bottled Victorian Lemonade. That was bizarre. Avoid that unless you really really like ginger. I do not so I didn't like it.

I took my boyfriend and his dad here as a thank you for helping me move all day. His dad accidentally left his new iPhone and we realized within two minutes of walking out. I ran back in and the new people already sitting at the table didn't have a clue. The manager said they probably threw it out with the trash and wouldn't let me dig through to find it. They did take down our name and number to call if they ever received it. That seemed to be all they could do and I reluctantly returned to the car.We called a few times and within five minutes, someone had turned it off.

I was excited to hear that they sell rattlesnake and alligater sausages.  The decor was very trendy/hipster, artsy and nice. At first I couldn't find this place because it looked like part of the other warehouse structures. The way you order is interesting, you have to line up in one entrance, then eat or to go at the other end. I can see it lets you explore the space which in itself is an art.  I ordered their rattlesnake/rabbit (has an al dente texture), alligator/pork, and traditional Bratwurst (I was really hungry, i did share with my partner :).  I ordred a side of Groot fries. The food is amazing. Their beers are amazing too!!  I tried their Apple Ale (fabulous and refreshing), Koestritzer Schwarzbier (this one tastes like chocolate), and strawberry ale (much lighter with a hint of strawberry). I will come back and try other sausage combinations and their other beers!  Just writing about this place just makes me really excited for some reason ^_^  In my opinion, its much better than standing in line at Pinks Hotdogs.

The Belgian fries are pretty good too, overly salty (how I like 'em) and a large size is plenty enough for two to split.Visit #24:15 Sunday afternoon.  No line outside the premise and only had a handful of people waiting in line.Alligator & Pork - a little overcooked, but still one hell of a combo.  Definitely had some kick to it, but that good kind of spicy kick that lingers awhile in the mouth.  Luckily, I had the perfect Schwarzbier to wash it down.  I'd go for it again, though best comparison is similar to a hot & spicy Italian sausage.Overall, expect to pay no less than $10 for a sandwich & beverage at the bare minimum.  Kind of pricey, but where else are you going to find anything like this nearby?Tips -  go on off peak hours to avoid the lines.  There is some non metered parking street parking further up on Traction - look for the head in spaces."},{"date":"2013-08-16","rating":"5.0","review":"Most amazing truffle fries in LA!!

We has two orders of large Belgian fries (one glazed, one not) for the three of us. They were gone by the end of our meal. My favorite dipping sauces here the tzatziki and chipotle aioli. I like that the fries came before the dogs, because we had ample time to savor and enjoy the fries as an item itself.Then the dogs came. We had two exotic sausages - the rattlesnake and rabbit one and a duck and bacon with , as well as a gourmet mango and jalapeño one. Because we're all food fatties and understand each other, we all tried all of the dogs and weighed in on the taste tests.

The only things holding this place back from a five star rating is the wait and the price. $6 - $8 for one hot dog is a steep price to pay, especially when it'll take about two to fill me up. Add in over an hour wait, and I can't give this place a perfect rating. The food alone however is top notch, both due to the quality of the sausages and the unique flavors available. Duck & Bacon Sausage - Wow...such an unexpected experience to get from a sausage. The thing tasted like roasted duck! Deep duck flavor. The bacon adds the salt and smoke reminiscence of roasted duck. So awesome. Beware that this is a bit of a heavy sausage.Sun Dried Tomato and Mozzarella -  The chicken and turkey makes the sausage light and delicate. The mozzarella fulls in with fat and adds a rich and creamy element that just melts in your mouth. And finally the sun dried tomato comes in at the end and just punches you with acid. Such great layering of flavors. This was my favorite of the day.Mango Jalapeno - Great balance of sweet and spicy. My only complaint would be that it was served a bit lukewarm while I think it would taste amazing if piping hot.Fries - Thick cut fries with great seasoning. The outside is is crispy and crunchy, but the inside is soft and buttery. Great hybrid of a fry and potato wedge.Sauces - The whole grain mustard and honey mustard are fantastic. The spice is almost like wasabi. The curry ketchup is out of this world. Amazing curry flavor and not overly sweet like most ketchups. The bleu cheese walnut and bacon is great. Sweet, creamy, lightly salty and mildly pungent. However, its more like a spread than a dip. I actually smeared it on top of my extra bun.I shall return."},{"date":"2012-09-05","rating":"4.0","review":"I've been here a few times now.  I'll keep this review  relatively short and concise:Food:  large selection of unique and \"safe\" sausages for those not so adventurous eaters; however, I found the unique sausages (ie. rattlesnake) to be very user friendly regardless of the eater.  I haven't tried one I didn't like so far and I thoroughly enjoyed the toppings.  The fries are great and the sauce selection allows for variety each time.

They're not the best I would definitely stick to the exotic sausages or one of the classics. I tried the sundried tomato sausage first and I wasn't the biggest fan until I came back and tried something else. However, the fries are on open and might even be my favorite part of the experience.

I ordered one of the exotic sausages (Duck and Jalapeno), and a large order of fries to share with the person joining me.The sausage was well cooked, well seasoned, and pretty filling. The truffle fries were unbelievable, and some of the best I've ever had. I'm a stickler for good fries, and this place delivered. The beer selection was decent, but I have seen better.Now, why not a 5 star? It is not \"first-timer\" friendly. You order your food at the front, walk to the back, and they bring you your food. There are no waiters/waitresses, only servers who run food. The problem is, if this is your first time, you have no idea what kind of portions they deliver, and the fries were not enough for two. When I tried to ask for more, they told me to go back around to the front (as my sausage and beer got stale). Sure enough, there was a line out the door when I went back to order. So I had to decide between not being full, or letting my food get cold and my beer get flat. Thus, if you don't already know what you're doing at this place, an incorrect decision could really ruin it for you.Luckily, the food was amazing, and if you go with someone experienced, you should be fine."},{"date":"2013-04-16","rating":"5.0","review":"Every time I'm in LA for a photoshoot in the area I definitely must stop here!They're food is amazingand they have an awesome selection of imported beers."},{"date":"2010-07-06","rating":"4.0","review":"Constantly coming back here to feel like Andrew Zimmern (except the G-rated version).Consuming Snakes from a Plane and Thumper's family members since 2009, with a side of Truffle Fries and Chimay Blue."},{"date":"2012-11-11","rating":"3.0","review":"the line to order was fereaking long.we had the mango jalapeno, santa fe jack and hot italian. they were pretty good, i have no complaints.   i wish i tried the exotic sausages though.seating is cafeteria style, so you end up commingling with other patrons. the lighting is dim and the music is loud, it's hard to carry a conversation without punctuating it with \"WHAT?\" and the you-still-don't-understand-what-they-said-but-you-don't-want-to-ask-them-to-repeat-themselves-again nod.  we even got a sip of the (alleged) $200 beer.  tastes like hite.it wasn't anything spectacular, but i'd go back just to try the duck bacon sausage"},{"date":"2013-10-13","rating":"5.0","review":"Worst what? I hate not being able to pronounce the name of these fancy German places :(. But its okay at least the menu isn't in German, so I'm clear.PARKING:  Tons of free parking around the area, you just need to be fairly lucky to find a spot.  It can get pretty scary at night since its not in the best neighborhood.  However, if you are worried about that, luckily there is $2 parking really close by.FOOD: They have a good selection of sausages to choose from (probably 10-20?) and I ended up choosing the Rattlesnake and Rabbit sausage. Everyone on Yelp seemed to recommend it and I'm a big fan of exotics myself.  Exotic sausages come out to be $8, while the other sausages are $6.  Each sausage comes with a bun and 2 toppings/sides.  I like mine with onions and hot peppers, which came out delicious.  But next time, I'm going with the sweet peppers since my friend got that on her sausage and it turned out just as good.  The snake tasted so good in my mouth and the whole time I didn't even realize I was eating snake. They also offer fries on the side, that come with two dipping sauces (about 8 sauces to choose from in total). I saw a tip about how amazing the fries tasted with truffle oil, but I didn't get it with that. Just plain fries with pesto mayo and chipotle aioli.  Fries were average ($4 I think?).SERVICE: I went around dinner time, around 6, and the line was just getting started.  A big crowd, but the servers and waiters knew how to handle.  There was one girl who was walking around the line to ask each customer about their tastes and providing recommendations. That was a nice and personal touch to the service.Once you are done ordering, the servers will bring your order to your table.  Tables are located in the back end of the restaurant, a hidden spot almost.  For a second, I thought there was no seating in the restaurant since I didn't know there was a bar and seating area further down the restrooms.  Dim and dark? Hey! almost the perfect setting for a date, except with sausages and beer.  Coming back? Yes, but I'm definitely using the restaurant as a date spot next time ;)."},{"date":"2015-06-14","rating":"5.0","review":"Visited again Saturday 13 June 2015.  Amazing crew! Manager AWESOME!!!

At first, I was expecting something like Dog Haus in Pasadena, but the vibe is completely different. The actual dog is completely different and unconventional. I believe they grind their meats/vegetables and make it into a hot dog. The bread that they even use is absolutely delicious. The bread is something like you would use for a sandwich and not necessarily for a hot dog, but it works. I loved my duck dog with a jalapeno blend. It was quite flavorful.Also, they have some great beers, especially German beers on tap. We came here during lunch time, and it was very packed. However, we lucked out and did not have to wait in a long line.I love the industrial looking interior of this place. The metal coffin container for the hot dog and the coffin inspired tables in the back are pretty morbid.This is a place where someone has to introduce you because you would not just find it out of the blue.

I have to say it is in a weird location where there are some warehouses. Not a lot of people were here so I was glad for that. We decided to order 4 sausages and split each of them between us. Great plan and I suggest to do the same if you come here with other people.We decided to order the following (each with sweet peppers and onions on top):Snake - okay. decent at best but nothing outstanding sticks out for me.Filipino - it was a bit sweet but you can't taste it at first. If you are Filipino (like me), then definitely DO NOT order this. It would make no sense for you to order this since LONGANISA is way better!Gator - not bad but not great either. Duck - this was by far the best. unique flavor with a bit of spice. I'd definitely order this again!I also ordered the 1809 beer which had a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Not sure if i'd order this again either. I can't blame the restaurant for bad beer but they do have a do selection which is good for people to try and revisit this place.Overall - the food is average with a little pricier than expected. Each of these exotic sausages were about $7.50 and the beer prices range from $6-$15. I'd give this a 3.5 stars. I think I would try the buffalo and veal next time I come back here. Yup, I said it...

Rattlesnake/rabbit hot dogs and imported beers that all have their own special designated glass? Way to be unique and of course attract the HOARDS of hipsters that ravage this place on a nightly basis, and on good grounds. The sausages here are succulent, juicy, and soulful and the beer selection is insanely unique. My favorite here is the KWOK amber beer, complete with its own glass that has a rounded bottom and so comes with a wooden stand for it! You can easily spend $20+ here, especially since the exotic beers range from $6-10/glass. Pabst draft is $2.50 officially making it the cheapest drink you can order here, but why the hell would you come all the way to Wurstkuche for a PBR? get out of the line, hipster kid.The atmosphere is cozy and very communal with a modern/sleek edge to it. You order when you get in, find a seat anywhere and they bring your food to you, but you get the beers when you order. There's also a bar in the seating area, if you're in the mood for more beer and don't want to bother waiting in the hot dog order line again."},{"date":"2014-05-28","rating":"5.0","review":"Amazing place and even has 3 vegetarian options for the sausages.

They have a wide selection of snausages ranging from vegetarian TO chicken TO traditional TO alligator meat TO a rattlesnake/rabbit fusion. I ordered the vegetarian/apple and it almost blew out a taste bud. Fries aint bad either...eerily similar to Pommes Frites. Additionally, they have a nice selection of german beer.

Their fries (go truffle fries and chipotle aioli) and drink options are also great. Get an elderflower soda,too, or one of their fantastic brews and enjoy. They've also created a great space with wonderful material choices. Their wood tables range in size to accommodate both small and large parties.

The place looks small because all you see is the ordering counter and the glass containing the assortment of sausages. However, after you place your order, they'll inform you that the tables are located in the back, you gotta walk past the ordering counter to the right =) Dining area looks like a cafeteria/place where you would celebrate Oktoberfest! The menu is printed on a half sheet paper. Menu is straight forward, you pick 2 toppings for your hot dogs, listing of regular sausages, gourmet sausages, exotic sausages, and lots & lots of beer on tap! I ordered the bacon, duck, and jalapeno sausage and boyfriend ordered the buffalo, beef, and pork sausage. We also ordered the large belgian fries with the curry ketchup, thai peanut, chipotle ketchup, and pesto mayo dipping sauces . For drinks we both ordered beer. Our total was about $39, that's a bit too much for for hot dogs..I think the bacon duck hot dog was very flavorful, it was a bit too spicy for me. Can't really taste the duck or bacon, to be honest, it tasted just like a regular sausage to me but with just a kick. I tried boyfriend's buffalo/beef/pork hot dog and it tasted about the same, but not as strong. Boyfriend enjoyed his hot dog =)I think the best part of the meal was the belgian fries! yum!! They're pretty thickly cut fries cooked to perfection. The dipping sauces all were good and different. Chipotle ketchup tasted like regular ketchup with a slight kick to it. Pesto mayo didn't really appeal to me, it tasted just like pesto. Thai peanut was ok, it tastes like light watery peanut butter. I liked the curry ketchup the best! Must try!Overall it's a different experience, I enjoyed it, I want to try the other sausages! =D yum"},{"date":"2014-01-27","rating":"5.0","review":"This place is an awesome spot to go anytime of the week!

We cranked up the music in the car and danced in the streets we were so happy. The choices were plentiful in the beer and sausage department. I had a mango chicken weenie and a dark stout (Sorry I forgot the name of it). It was a little tough to find a spot, but with a live DJ spinning some indie music, it was well worth it. A great topper to our night. And, since it was my birthday, friend Joe bought my sausage, and friend Greg bought my beer. Whaaaat? Get out! I was seriously happy.

If you walk up and there looks like the line is out the door, it is mainly because the front area where you order is very small so it is easy to spill over outside. It usually moves pretty quick and they serve you beer once you get inside and are waiting. The sausages are all great, but I come for the beer and fries! All the German and Belgian beers are delicious and I love how they match every single one on draft with their respective glasses. The fried with truffle oil and sun-dried tomato mayo and pesto mayo are amazing as well. I usually go with the Chicken Apple and Spices sausage with spicy peppers and caramelized onions. There are also about 5-6 mustard's in the back to choose from.

Couldn't exactly set my mind to eat rattlesnake and rabbit just because people recommended it but at last I conformed. Right before we placed our order, a guy who seemed like the manager came out and announced that they had NO MORE BUNS. ???? What kind of hot dog place runs out of buns??? He explained that they were FROZEN and REALLY OLD BUNS. Now my question is why do you guys still have them if they're so old you can't serve them?? It kinda sounded more like because they didn't defrost them in time, they couldn't serve them. SHADYYYYYYY!!!! Not only that they didn't offer any compensation to make up for the lack of buns and still charged us the hot dogs as regular price. A hot dog just isn't a hot dog without the bun!! So, one of my friends just ended up not ordering anything.Since it was my first time, I was asking the guy who took my order for some recommendations. He kind of had an attitude problem like omg just order whatever you like but just thought it and didn't say it. Then when I asked which sauce for the fries were the best ones he was also like IDK people order all kinds..... Well obviously!! That's why I asked you for the popular ones!! Then I joked and was like I should get a free sauce (75 cents) since there's NO BUNS on my hot dog and he just looked at me like omfg are you kidding me/get outta here. He was just bad attitude all around and I was not pleased with the TERRIBLE SERVICE.The food was alright but totally NOT WORTH THE HYPE. Maybe I would've liked it more if my sausage came with a bun!!

They have outside seating too on great sunny days.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the service. The bartenders are generally women and they are all pretty cool.  It's the manager that I've not been impressed by.  After making a reservation we brought a group of 15 in (clients after a long shoot day) so we could eat and relax.  But when we arrived they were not prepared, and no space reserved. (The place is usually busy so we made sure we had booked some space ahead of time.)  The manager wasn't very helpful and even challenged whether we'd made the reservation.  After taking their time, we eventually got the space we needed. It was annoying and certainly didn't make us look good to our clients.  And again, the manager seemed less than concerned whether we were taken care of.  I guess they're doing so well they don't need to worry about things like that.But that was just one incident and every other time we've been there things have been great."},{"date":"2012-05-21","rating":"3.0","review":"I'm glad I waited until after a few visits to write this review, otherwise it probably would've gotten a 5 star review from me.The quality just isn't like it use to be.

It's crowded Thursdays - Sunday from about 7pm on, so I would recommend getting there around 6pm if you want to snag a good seat. Seating is the most difficult thing about this place as it's \"beer hall\" first come, first served, and if you have a large group you should make reservations or get there early!They only do three things here - sausages, fries, and beer. And all three are great. The dipping sauces with the fries are my favorite - curry ketchup (like the UK and USA had a ketchup baby), blue cheese/walnut/bacon - YUM!, buttermilk ranch (the best ranch I've had), even tzatziki! Sausages can be a little dry, so don't skimp on the toppings and add on the onions, kraut, peppers, whatever. You can always scrape it off later if you don't like it. Spicy peppers are little more than sauteed jalapenos, and the bell peppers could be a little more done, but the onions and kraut are great.After trying every sausage on the menu, I've settled on the Filipino Marharlika and the Rabbit White Wine sausages as my two favorite. The Filipino sausage is nice and juicy and the Rabbit White Wine has a great flavor. Great place for dinner but be prepared to be friendly - it's crowded and you'll be sharing butt space with strangers."},{"date":"2013-08-07","rating":"4.0","review":"Like a candystore of Sausage and fries and beer.   A true delight for anyone who adores these categories of food in a festive setting.  It's restaurants like this that make me feel like I live in a big city."},{"date":"2014-02-17","rating":"4.0","review":"I've tried everything at this place and prefer the bratwurst topped off with sauerkrauts and sweet peppers.

They have suuuch a variety of sausages, it's amazing! I never realized you could practically make ANYTHING into a sausage until I saw their menu.I tried the Mango & Jalapeno (chicken/turkey) based on a recommendation, and the fact that weird meats and meat combinations freak me out. To compliment my sausage I added caramelized onions and sweet peppers, although this is misleading because the onions are simply grilled, not caramelized at all :(Friend got the Sun-dried tomato & Mozzarella (chicken/turkey) which I remembered being good, but I think I liked the Mango Jalapeno better.We ordered a large fry to split and holey moley do you get a lot! They're super thick cut and Belgian style. We chose Curry Ketchup (strong curry flavor) and Sundried Tomato Mayo (I am such a sucker for SD tomatoes!) to dip. The fries were good but I think since they're twice fried, some were kinda burnt :\\ Although I do appreciate the potato meatiness from the thick cut.For drinks, they have a huge selection of craft beers and even craft sodas. I went with a strawberry beer on tap (sticking to the fruity sweetness of my meal) which was really tasty!The communal seating here is.. different. The picnic tables are difficult to get in/out of and you are bound to have someone trying to \"squeeze through\" brush their butt up against your back. -___- this happened multiple times, hahaPlus, the tables are covered with butcher paper and aren't continually replaced... You can imagine eating over someone's previous ketchup squirts on the table! It's a different experience but next time I'm definitely sitting elsewhere.I'll be back for a spicy sausage and hoppy brew next time.

I mean, I have enough self-realization to be able to look at myself in the mirror after getting dressed and sure, sometimes I wear scarves when it's only 72 degrees out.  And a quick scan of my iTunes reveals that I dig me some Black Keys, Passion Pit, Belle & Sebastian. And yes, I own a pair of TOMS. That said, Wurstkuche might be a bit too hipster for me.Came here for a quick lunch and maybe I ruined my appetite by eating macarons beforehand but I thought the whole experience was just OK.  Ordering was a cluster of confusion (there was no organized line) and a bit rushed and not very personable.  I got the hot italian with caramelized oinon and sweet peppers.  It really was just ok and I've had better.  We got a large order of the fries with truffle glaze and that was especially tasty with the chipotle ketchup. A bit pricey but I'm sure when you're here and in the right mood, you're really paying for the ambiance. Sigh, maybe I just ordered the wrong thing? Maybe I was in the wrong mood?I bet this place is really neat at night and I bet really cute boys come here with form fitting leather jackets and skinny jeans and they talk about music I've never heard of and they drink really cool, dark European beer that's like 30% proof or something.  And they sit at those cool long tables or those smaller oblong tables that make it really hard for three people to eat at.  I'm sure if I came here at night and if I had another sausage, I'd like it better.  But maybe Wurstkuche is simply cooler than me."},{"date":"2012-11-20","rating":"4.0","review":"My playmate MM and I stopped by for dinner.

I tried the rattlesnake and rabbit, and my boyfriend got the rabbit, veal and pork. Both were decent, but none of the flavors of the sausages stood out. Though the sausages were juicy, I really couldn't taste the difference between these exotic sausages and regular ones. As someone who likes my food with stronger flavors, I found my rattlesnake bland and ended up covering it in mustard, ketchup and the Sweet & Sassy BBQ dipping sauce. If I were to come back here, I'd definitely opt for one of the sausages listed as \"packed with flavor\" instead of \"light\" or \"buttery.\"The white truffle oil fries were fantastic though! They paired very well with the bleu cheese walnut and bacon dipping sauce which was tasty, but didn't overpower the truffle unlike the BBQ sauce.The ambiance of this place certainly evokes the vibe that you really are in the heart of LA's Art District. The set-up is unusual with a long elementary school-style dining table with several smaller tables available for seating. The dim lighting and communal seating reminded me of some sort of Old German dining hall (think Beowulf) with a modern, trendy twist.I can't speak for the beer - I am not a fan so I didn't try any, but the selection was impressive. I'm sure I would have appreciated this joint more if I liked beer.Overall, this place is fun and unique and worth a visit if you're really into sausages or beer.

The sauces are pretty tasty but its pretty gross that you have to pass the community condiments back and forth touching the same sticky area where people have just licked their fingers clean.   I'm liking the festive atmosphere, but they have to fix the area where you go up to order your food.   Which way is the line going???  where does it start?   Mad chaos is never good environs to stimulate your palate."},{"date":"2010-07-12","rating":"5.0","review":"Wurstküche has a plethora of sausage.

When I was in Germany three years ago, I enjoyed many tasty delights, none of which were brat or brotwurst, as they say (\"brot\" is german for bread, so this \"wurst\" is intended to be eaten on bread!). I had salads, Italian, Italian, Italian, and wonderful cheese, fruit, and meat resto bars. The food was fresh and zingy - I can remember the site of white asparagus fields south of Frankfurt.So when I walked into Wurstkueche in Los Angeles, I expected nothing short of the very best wunder-brotwursts they could find. Beer, truffle fries, dipping sauces--I accompanied my meal with the proper fixins' and got down to business.I had heard such wonderful reviews of the place from American and German friends. Everyone always asks: \"oh, have you been to wurstkuche yet? Well, if you love hotdogs, then this is the place for you!\" So it was a signed deal - I had to try it out.I ordered the austin blues dog my first time there. It's a mix of pork and multiple peppers, which I thought I'd adore, topped with more peppers and onions. What's not to like? Well, it tasted like any other hot dog. The truffle friends, as other writers have stated, weren't truffle-y enough for me. You could barely get a grasp of the truffle flavor.It's called spicy, though doesn't require water. I'm tired of going to restaurants, asking for something spicy, and have it sizzle in at a 4.5. If it's not seriously spicy, don't pretend to warn me about it.I really wished that there wasn't a hub-bub surrounding their food before I walked in. If you can make nice fries, select wonderful beers, and give me an average wurst, I'm going to pass.  It wasn't overpriced, but if I can get a better product at a gas station in the midwest, I'm not likely to return.I walked away disappointed. Was it too American? Was I too American? I guess I should go back, as my German friend suggested, and get the real German \"bratwurst.\" Ah-ha. Maybe that's what they've been raving about - the raw-gold dogger.Returning to Wurstkuche, again, to try the real, though plain bratwurst, I was hopeful. However, again, walked out a little disappointed in my fare. It was plain food dressed up well with sauces and some beer to go along with it.In sum, I don't think I'd go back to wurstkuche. The ambiance there was nice - and I may go back  just for that open-air downtown scene. It's almost like a club in there it's so dark (I sat down at about 9pm at an outside table).  However, the place is almost always too crowded for a free seat to be available anywhere in the house.

I dont like over burnt food, sorry."},{"date":"2010-12-06","rating":"4.0","review":"Worst coochie.  That's what it sounded like my friend said for this restaurant she wanted to take me to.  I don't know about you but, something with the word \"coochie\" in it is probably not on my list of restaurants I'd like to dine at.  Turns out it's German and actually spelled Wurstküche.  Phew.When we walked in, there was a girl explaining all the different types of sausages to the patrons in line.  I wasn't really in the mood to try anything out of the ordinary, so I got the Chicken Apple and Spice sausage topped with Caramelized Onions and Spicy Peppers, Klein (small) fries with Buttermilk Ranch dressing, and Fentiman's Victorian Lemonade.There's a huge dining area in the back, but before you head there you should stop off at the little water cooler which has cucumber flavored water (for free).  It's quite refreshing and I like the little water cooler it's in.Either way, make your selection of which table you'd like to sit at and place your number placard in plain view for the servers to see.  I got the lemonade first while waiting for my food and it tasted a little weird to me.  There's like less than 0.5% alcohol, but I could still tell there was some in there.  Plus there are strong flavors of like beer and ginger in the lemonade.  It's also carbonated which made everything taste different.  Definitely wasn't what I was expecting.I was so hungry, so when he came around for my number, 35, I was suuuuuuuper excited.  I added a little ketchup and honey mustard and took my first bite of my very first Worst Coochie, I mean, Wurstküche sausage.  The roll they used for the sausages was waaaaaay better than regular hot dog buns.  Everything together made my Chicken Apple & Spices Sausage pretty amazing.  The fries, though, are to die for.  I love love love ranch and ketchup with my fries, so I squeezed a bunch of ketchup in the buttermilk ranch dressing and that, let me tell you, became a reee-donkulous dipping sauce.  I also tried my friend's pesto mayo french fry dipping sauce, but was less than impressed by it.The fries alone would bring me back here.  Parking outside is generally metered only, but it wasn't too difficult to find a spot."},{"date":"2014-05-02","rating":"4.0","review":"I know it sounds scary, but, GET THE RATTLESNAKE!!

Went on a Friday night and I must say, this place was not easy to find. We literally circled the surrounding area a handful of times before we found the little street we were suppose to turn on. Once that hot mess was done, parking was a bit of a struggle but we managed to find a spot a couple blocks away. The line was long but it was helpful and time consuming to look over the menu while waiting...made the line move quicker. It was also cool to be able to order a drink (beer) while waiting in line. I was tempted to drink it up before I reached the register so I wouldn't get charged but that's just not right...but I thought about it ;)The area to order food is not that big but once you make your way to the back the space definitely opens up. After you order they give you a number then you walk down a long hall where the bathrooms are located and you find yourself in a room with long cafeteria type seating, a DJ spinning in the corner, a bar, dark lighting, and groups of people laughing and having a good time. I like that they have cucumber water in the front and the back for free.Let's talk food...my friend and I had ourselves a sausage fest...Rattlesnake & Rabbit- I didn't know what to expect but I must say it was juicy and buttery. It was a bit spicy because of the jalapenos but it was very delicious. My favorite one out of the 4 we ordered. Duck & Bacon- Also spicy because of the jalapeno peppers but OMG it was succulent and the juciest of them all. My 2nd favorite for sure!Mango Jalapeno- Chicken and turkey sausage, definitely tasted the mango and it was good nothing too special. Glad I tried it but I'd rather have something more exotic on my next trip.Sun Dried Tomato & Mozzarella- smoked chicken and turkey, I liked the flavors and I thought it was very tasty. Glad I tried :)*I'm allergic to large quantities of pork so these 4 choices were perfect even thought they all have pork casings. **Two toppings (sauerkraut, caramelized onions, sweet peppers, spicy peppers) are allowed. I really loved the caramelized onions and sweet peppers. Belgian Fries- They were good, I love fries. I wasn't a fan of the 2 dipping sauces we chose; blue cheese walnut and bacon, curry ketchup. The blue cheese was too thick and I really didn't distinguish the flavors. The curry ketchup was too strong for me but I'm not really a fan of curry to begin with. There are 10 dipping sauce choices so I will do some better exploring next time. I did enjoy the white truffle oil glaze on the fries...YUM! Cost $2 extra but it's pretty good.I went with a Belgian beer, Fruli- fermented with strawberry. It was a bit too sweet for my taste but it had good flavor and was refreshing.I had a good experience, I didn't get sick from digesting an entire farm that night so all in all I would say this place is a success!"},{"date":"2013-01-04","rating":"4.0","review":"Great place.

I guess I've never had a good sausage, because I thought mine was super delicious. The first thing to know is that you'll probably have to wait in line. It was about a 20 minute wait before we ordered (on a Sunday night), and then we had to wait a little bit for some spots to open up. The wait was well worth it though. I got the duck & bacon w/ jalapeno sausage, some fries, and the Gouden Carolus (belgian beer). I highly recommend all three. So freaking delicious. I will definitely be back."},{"date":"2011-01-19","rating":"3.0","review":"To be fair, we were probably asking for trouble by showing up for dinner at 7 pm on a Saturday. But WHOA that line was huge! A couple of us went to hold down a table, a couple others went to the (short) line at the bar, and the others were stuck standing in line for 45 minutes to order food (and it's outside, so you can't really even drink while you're waiting). That's a long time to wait for the privilege of ordering sausages and frites.I was all excited about the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage as soon as I heard about it, but considering it had jalapenos in it, it really wasn't very spicy at all. It tasted like a chicken sausage - good, but not that memorable. The frites were OK but we weren't blown away by the dipping sauces. The sun-dried tomato mayo was good, but the pesto was so bland it seemed like it didn't even have pesto in it at all. And yes, as a previous reviewer said, $11 for a mini-bottle of Framboise is pretty steep. They do have some tasty gourmet sodas, but the Fentiman's Victorian Lemonade that cost $5 at Wurstkuche was $2.50 at a nearby convenience store. Meh.There's not much to say about the service because they don't really serve you, other than bringing the food to your table. Sausages range from $6-8 and fries are $4-6 (dipping sauce included). Takeout is probably the way to go here, especially on insanely busy weekend nights."},{"date":"2010-05-15","rating":"4.0","review":"Would you like a bite of my Hot Italian Sausage?After hearing so much about this place It was immediately added to my must try list, and for my birthday a friend of mine asked me where I would like to go, and this was my first choice!After not having a decent sausage since i moved out here, coming from Lancaster, PA and having a surplus of German & Italian joints around I'm glad to say that I've finally found a great place to get a good sausage or brat. We came in on a Saturday afternoon, and there was not much of a line, but man the place was packed. After we ordered they gave us our number signs and we took a venture around back and ended up sitting outside. They brought us our food no more than 10minutes later, and we dug in!MMMmmmmmm!! Finally a real spicy hot Italian sausage just like from back home! It was juicy and grilled just right! top it with sauerkraut and it was perfect! My friend got the Filipino one which was a sweet pork sausage and being the small child she is, she couldn't finish it and I got the last couple bites! It was certainly sweet, and she said it definitely reminded her of Filipino style cooking.Overall the place has a very cool feel, and is located in a pretty decent neighborhood, just a few blocks away from Little Tokyo.

Initially I thought its location would make it difficult to find and drive to but it was surprisingly easy to find. We came from the 60W (reside in Hacienda Heights.) Ordering was a different experience but it was enjoyable to drink some beer while we were waiting to order. The employees were helpful and knowledgeable! Great selection of beers and obviously sausages! I felt adventurous and tried the Alligator and Rabbit with Veal sausages and let me tell you they were delicious! Not a big fan of the regular Swedish fries but the dips were so good and they were plentiful. Seating inside was interesting since it was open(minus reserved) but at least they have outside seating. Two dogs, some beer, and fries filled me up a plenty. We even split dessert which was taste but you can't enjoy it after eating everything we had. I recomend you go with friends and split the hot dogs amongst yourselves to try them all!I am definitely coming back  to try some sausages I may have missed out on!Don't forget to cheer legitimately!

Parking is horrendous."},{"date":"2010-05-17","rating":"3.0","review":"First of all, parking is a bitch. It took me about 10 minutes to drive to JTown, and another 10 minutes just circling the block trying to find a spot. We finally found one that was a little walk away, but I guess that's better than nothing.While the line is snaking out the door, that's not such a bad thing. That's quality time that you can spend perusing through the menu and trying to decide what you want out of about 20 options of hotdogs. Everything from the classic bratwurst, to the more gourmet jalapeno/mango or green chillies/cilantro flavours, all the way to the exotic rattlesnake, rabbit, duck and alligator varieties. Choose 2 toppings from sauerkraut, caramalized onions, sweet peppers or spicy peppers, and you're done. And since the line is so long, they take your drink order first. Not only are you busy deciding on what to eat, you've got a nice, cold beer in your hand to sip on at the same time. But once it is your turn, place your order, grab a number and head on to the back of the restaurant and take a seat along the long wooden tables.The hotdog itself was pretty ok but there was one MAJOR problem - THE HOTDOG WAS SHORTER THAN THE BUN T_______T !! That left me with tasteless, plain bites of bread on both sides. I was so sad. However, the fries were tasty but they were made even better by the dipping sauces. We tried the curry ketchup and the sundried tomato mayo. The curry ketchup was crazy! Such a weird combination of flavours that worked so well. Addicting.So dear Wurstkuche, size matters. Better lengthen those sausages or else I would always be left feeling very unsatisfied."},{"date":"2014-01-01","rating":"4.0","review":"Great afternoon, chill-out music in a nice open environment.  Great french fries and sauces.  Fancy ginger beer."},{"date":"2013-11-05","rating":"3.0","review":"Meh.

I've had the veggie dog and the Filipino dog (it's spicy) and both were delicious. Sometimes veggie dogs in general can be a little chalky tasting, but not here!

I must also give it up to Wurstkuche for introducing me to my favorite thing ever: St. Louis Framboise, which is an alcoholic raspberry cider tasting drink (you can find a large bottle of this at Trader Joes for only 9 bucks!!) .The reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is mostly due to the difficulty in finding seating. This place is a very popular location in LA (as evidenced by its over 3000 reviews). But oh my goodness, finding seating can be such a chore at times.

Jk.The bf has been talking about this place for a while now, and so he decided to take me here on Sunday! It was a cold gloomy ass rainy as hell fuckin day..but on we went! I was confused when I walked in. It's a small room and you see a hallway to the left, but I thought the room we were in was the place. There's a little bar table on the sides with chairs, so..you know..it gives that impression. Looked at the menu, was kind of stuck on what to order but I got the Kielbasa which consists of Polish style, pork and beef, onions and spices. They give you two toppings on each and I gottttt..caramelized onions and spicy peppers. YUM.The reason why my bf wanted to take me here was because of their choice of beers. Being completely honest here..I HATE BEER. I cannot stand the taste, it's nastay. Sorry to all you beer lovers out there.. :/ it's just a no can do for me. So why in the hell did he take me here? Because there is a strawberry beer that he swears tastes pretty much like strawberries. So that's what I got. Aren't I a trooper? Oh, and he ordered the Austin Blues which consists of hot and spicy, tri-pepper, & hardwood smoked pork, with the 2 sides of I think it was the same as mine. Don't remember. He also got some type of beer which I don't remember lolz. Walked down the mysterious hallway and as we reached the end and turned to the left, it was a big room that looked somewhat like a cafeteria to me. We walked into a room with giant sliding doors it looked like and sat ourselves down. Moments later our food arrived and it looked booommmb diggity! We also got fries :D . But, I took a bite out of my bratwurst (which burned my lip barely) and it was good! As I kept going more and more into the little brat, that shit kept getting spicier and spicier. The beer was..good. I was able to drink it, but it still had that slight beer-ish flavor, obviously. It was good though. I gave my little grossed out faces throughout some sips, but was able to drink it like a champ. We pretty much killed our meal, and both of us were stuffed and stuffed. You're able to help yourself to some water and silverware and stuff at the bar on the side. Bf came back with 2 glasses of water that tasted just like cucumbers.. Don't know how I feel about that. And it wasn't cold so it was a little meh. Flavor was decent. It wasn't amazing but it was good. I think I'll order something else the next time I go though."},{"date":"2013-08-15","rating":"2.0","review":"No one is talking about the taste of the sausage...u know why...just because u wrap a clever name and 1000 condiments on a piece of meat doesn't make it the best thing since cut and paste...I looked at the selection and choose 'mango n jalapeños'...2 distinctive tastes...with sweet peppers n grilled onions...and when it was all said and done....I couldn't remember the taste of the meat....hummm, that aint good.....frys...delic...sauces...coool...but I wanted to fall in love with the large selection of sausages in the show case but I aint sure I will....atmosphere was cool....sausage meat needs more flava....."},{"date":"2014-01-23","rating":"4.0","review":"Enjoyed the beer selection and also you can't go wrong with the Louisiana Hot Link."},{"date":"2012-05-09","rating":"5.0","review":"All come with fat caramelized onions; seating is in the back in communal bench areas.

How does this happen??  And the sauces were nothing spectacular.  Curry Ketchup? Just throw some indian curry powder in some Heinz.  Blue cheese dip? Could BARELY taste the blue cheese.  All I got were some bits of bacon.Don't get me wrong, this is a good restaurant with a fun concept (cafeteria bench style) where you are free to mingle with your neighbors and listen to techno/house music.  They do have some good brews on tap, namely the Franziskaner and the \"organic\" Edel weisse were delicious, albeit a little more on the pricey side (10 bux for 16.9 ounces...a little more than a pint).  Conclusion: For me, I'd just come back for a brew or two.  The wait time to order the food AND to receive the food exceeded an hour for the two of us ...Note: I don't know what they had in the rabbit dogs but something in there gave me a minor allergic reaction.  I've eaten rabbit, veal, and pork before so I don't know what could cause that to happen.  It was nothing major, just a week of rash on the face.  But still, I'd say watchout if you prone to allergic reactions."},{"date":"2012-06-17","rating":"4.0","review":"Yum!

So here's how it went down. We get there around 12.30pm and there was a short line, but no problem, it gave us time to peruse the menu. After deciding that we were gonna get 3 sausages to share between the 3 of us and the truffle fries, we then had to decide which ones to get.After ordering -- which included 2 beers as well -- we went to find a spot to sit down. It was like walking through an underground club or something.... down a walkway and then into the cafeteria-like dining room.So we loved our beers -- the apple ale and the framboise. I've had framboise before and at $11 a glass it was a serious rip-off considering you can get an entire bottle at Trader Joe's for less than $10. The apple ale we'd never tried before and it was lovely.Our truffle fries arrived and hmmm..... yeah there was indeed truffle flavor, but the fries themselves were unimpressive. Both BFF and I looked at each other and grimaced a little and then we both agreed that it was just O-K-A-Y.The sausages arrived......Duck, bacon and jalapeno -- okay this was definitely more flavorful than the one at Valhalla Table, although I couldn't taste bacon in it either.Artisan blue -- BFF said it was way salty to which I replied \"you're supposed to eat it with your beer I guess\" to which she made a face. This sausage had a nice snap to it which I liked, the casing was nice and crispy and the texture of the sausage was good. Flavor-wise, I was expecting something spicier seeing the description on the menu said it was spicy. Rattlesnake and rabbit -- for something that sounds so exotic it was rather boring. The spicy peppers condiment was not spicy at all and the caramelized onions was kinda anemic looking, not caramelized at all. What was the biggest ripper was that our meal came to $42 -- that's $21 bucks (tip not included) for beer and sausage!?!?!?!?!?!?!I do admit, this is far better than Valhalla Table, but I wasn't blown away. After all the reviews and my friends telling me about it, I was expecting to be completely knocked out by the food. Maybe I went in with higher expectations than others, maybe it wasn't a good day, whatever the reason, this isn't the place I would drive all the way from OC to specifically eat at.And while the sausages are better at Wurstkuche, Valhalla's buns are much better. I'm giving them 3.5 stars and with yelp not being able to give half stars in any shape or form, both Wurstkuche and Valhalla end up getting the same star rating although one is getting 2.75 which the other 3.5. As we left and walked to the car, BFF asked me what we should do now and then we were silent again for a minute and then she said \"you know, I feel ......\" and I said \"..... so bummed out?\" She said \"YEAH! Like my whole day is ruined!\". And then we said \"oh hey, DTLA is right there.... maybe we should go and get a bacon-wrapped hotdog to make up for it\"."},{"date":"2014-01-18","rating":"5.0","review":"Great atmosphere....delicious food....great beverages...always a good time."},{"date":"2014-04-14","rating":"2.0","review":"Got here at 11:30 on Saturday 4/12/2014.

I was very pleasantly surprised with my Vegetarian Italian Sausage. I thought it would be lacking in flavor and I was going to have to bathe it in sauces but it was good on its own. Maybe a little dry which is why I did put some sauce on it, but apart from that delicious the whole way through. The beer is what really got me. Tried a few out and even though I don't remember all of their names I wasn't disappointed. The one I do remember was the Gouden Carolus. Delicious. Smooth. Sweet with hints of pineapple. I know it's only 10am but I could definitely go for a beer and sausage right about now.The only reason I haven't given them 5 stars is because I feel their pricing is a little on the higher side for drinks.

(Attention) For those who are hankering a German affair (and I don't mean some BDSM swingers thing)  for some unique and hard core sausages, (hell offering rattlesnake, buffalo, duck , pheasant, etc) for those with exotic palettes, you must try Wurstkuche. It's worth the wait, and definitely a unique ambiance. Tucked away between Little Tokyo, and the Arts district near the industrial area of downtown, Wurstkuche at first seemed like just a small mom and pops stand, till you go down the corridor , which opens up to the dining area. Dimly lit, the area is popping, and it's quite homey feel, with a modern twist like an enhanced german pub feel with wood bench's and a great large bar. The menu is what you would expect from a purveyor of sausages.  A list of great beers, a great selection of tasty sausages, and the double dipped truffle oil fries, which has a condiment selection larger than what you can slather on your wiener.  My favorite must haves are the bratwurst (obviously), Italian, Mango Jalapeno and Chicken Apple w/spices.  If you're a true sausage eater, all you need is mustard and some onions, though on occasion, the peppers and sauerkraut is tasty to add with the bratwurst if you're in the mood for some tang and sourness.  For those daring, the exotic sausages are Buffalo or the Duck. I'm going to try the crocodile and lamb next, but this is what is cool about Wurstkuche, they are not afraid to offer these different game flavors to the public.  Like a german automobile , fearless to go over 200km on the nurburgring.

I also tried my bf's sausage (wait, that sounds wrong) and I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the two. However both were great. I think the best thing about this place is the sauces. We had the pesto mayo and bleu cheese bacon sauces with our double-fried fries and both were excellent. I also fell in love with their whole grain mustard... so much so that I wanted to steal a bottle. I was also thrilled that they serve my favorite soda, Mr. Q Cumber. I'll be back to sample the beers in the future but I'll be sure to come during the off-hours."},{"date":"2010-07-20","rating":"4.0","review":"This place pleasantly surprised me. I was weary at first, with the weird sausages, but I opted for one not so crazy, but still exotic and yummy. I had the apricot ginger sausages made with chicken and pork. They give you two little ones in a bun and they were yummy. There was like pureed apricot inside the sausage. The fries were SO YUMMY. I overindulged on those. I almost opted for the drizzled truffle oil, but didn't. I regretted not. The sauces are ridiculously good. I loved the pesto aioli, and the chipotle ketchup. The sun dried tomato aioli was yummy too.And the beer selection was amazing!!! There was a great strawberry girly beer I liked! Lots of choices and selections from all over Europe that you don't normally find, which is fun!If it hadn't been so hot, I would've sat outside, but next time. Lots of street parking which makes me happy :) Go check this place out, its definitely worth it.."},{"date":"2014-10-20","rating":"4.0","review":"It's great. Too great.

German afternoon delight sans beer.A variety of flavorful sausages located in a hidden DTLA location with only a little sign to know for a fact you are at Wurstkuche instead of a boring brick building. I was going to go for one of their exotic meats, but thought...if I really want to experience rattlesnake or alligator, I didn't want the  flavors hidden because it was mixed with pork and encased in a lining.I went German all the way with a Bockwurst, sauerkraut, and spicy peppers. Loved it!!. The flavors popped and exploded in my mouth. I just love sausages.The best were the Belgain fries. Twice fried and salted with large crunchy kosher salt. It was by far the best fries I've ever had..dipped in bleu cheese...how delightfully fattening. I could feel my arteries clogging up.Expensive??? Yes. 2 dogs, fries, and soda.....$24.

I honestly would've expected something like this in San Francisco but you know what?! I'm okay with this. A bit of hipster to LA only shows how diverse us Angelinos are. The seating is really really chill and they even have a DJ booth. I went here during a weeknight with one of my very good friends! I was stoked to go here since I heard so many good things about it! I can just say that the hype is well worth it. The line was pouring out the door when we finally arrived...which is always a good sign! The lady at the door greeted us with a warm welcome and handed us a menu and took our drink orders while we waited! They have an amazing selection of beers and I definitely will have to go back and try more of their flavorful beers. I got an apple ale which reminded me of Bruxelles and my time in Europe.The food is just as great but I was really saddened by the \"Belgian\" fries. I mean--no doubt were these fries good but incredibly misleading! I expected skinny, battered, fried goodness and the fries that I ordered were basically steak fries. Meh. I definitely was expecting some \"Belgian\" fries and not some generic rendition. As for the actual meal I had...Bockwurst was ahhhmazzzing! It was very flavorful and satisfying. I will mos def come back to tantalize my taste buds with some more exotic meats. I played it safe! All in all, I am going to come back!

Rattlesnake and Rabbit + Fries with Truffle Oil (pesto mayo) + Expensive Belgian BeerIf you come here as often as I do (30+ times)...Bratwurst + Fries with Truffle Oil (pesto mayo) + PBR ($2.50) This is absolutely the best PBR you can get on tap. I know, it's hipster beer, white trash beer, whatever. But it tastes good here, it's $2.50, and it gets me drunk. And when you order fries, you HAVE TO get truffle oil. It is too good.

I've also heard this is Ryan Gosslings favorite place to eat in LA, but I've never seen him.  I did see a girl who was on Arrested Development once, but that was the only celeb.After eating your sausage you'll probably be pretty full, but you HAVE to visit the Pie Hole across the street for dessert and get the Maple Custard pie.  HOLY HELL."},{"date":"2013-05-05","rating":"1.0","review":"This is what a certain \"Rocky M\" wrote to me in a private message:\"I just read your reviews, and I've come to the conclusion you have no idea what your writing about.

But yeah, dining area is not too big, and packed. Went here a few nights back for a friend's b-day and we got 9 people around one of their teeny dining room tables--sausages and fries for everyone, beers (four at a time for the birthday boy!), and we fit it all on one table.

I never would have found it.You order your meal in a small kitchen at the cashier, grab your number and walk down a long hallway to the main dining area. There are a few long communal wooden tables and benches. I love communal seating. Breaking bread together is how you make friends! The rest of the decor is somewhat lacking. They didn't quite achieve the spartan male-testosterone-beer-and-meat-screw-decor ambiance.We ordered off the exotic menu:Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers was our favorite. Juicy, sweet and tasted great. It didn't have a distinctive flavor but was good.Duck and Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers. My second favorite because it was full flavored, spicy and rich. Definitely didn't taste like your usual beef/pork/turkey.Rabbit, Veal and Pork Seasoned with White Wine was very good. The girlie sausage: surprisingly delicate and sweet. Tasted like a really good pork sausage. Couldn't identify the rabbit. Alligator and Pork, Smoked Andouille Sausage tasted like beef and was dry. I did like how the smoky spicy flavors sang through.Belgian fries: thick cut fries double dipped, fried, coated in white truffle oil glaze with bleu cheese walnut and bacon dressing. Fried potatoes tossed in oil and doused in a sauce made from three kinds of fats. I think these fries slid down my throat!

Parking in the nearby area was horrible, and we had to wait in a long line to get in, but what do you expect? It's downtown.Atmosphere: We all agreed that this place was like Father's Office, just switching out the burgers for sausages. Same hipster crowd, same trendy ambiance, same no-seating policy. I know this is a \"gastropub,\" but I personally feel that a bar should have bar seating, and a restaurant should have restaurant seating. Most people come here for sausages. Hovering over someone's table with a sausage and beer in your hands and waiting for them to leave, giving dirty looks to the douche (they're always the one who's a douche trying to get YOUR table) also vying for it, and then having someone stare YOU down while you eat, is not my idea of a nice night out. Anyway, pluses were the great beer selection and of course the sausages, fries and dipping sauces (try the rattlesnake one! Even if you think it's weird, TRY IT! It'll taste better than any of the \"safe\" ones you ordered!)

And since it was so close to the hotel we were staying at.When we arrived there was a pretty long line, but it was moving by pretty fast so we didn't have to wait too long. Finding a menu was rather difficult since it was being passed down from person to person. But then since the line was pretty long it gave us enough time to decide what type of sausage we wanted.One of the co-owners came by and was asking me what kind of beer I would like. I wasnt too sure since they have about 24 different beers on tap. So he said something to one of the servers and they brought over a beer..it was loud so I couldnt hear what beer it was called =_=but it was quite tasty.Mel had ordered a sun dried tomato and mozzarella and I ordered a duck and bacon jalapeno. Not sure what Henry and Tiana had but they seemed to enjoy it. We also got a side of fries which were good but I was more focused on the sausage.That duck and bacon jalapeno, a mixture of wonderful fatty goodness. Juices and oils coming out when I bit into it, not overly salty either. Oh yes to top off the dog, I got caramelized onions and red peppers.Overall it was a good time, a nice huge seating area in the back. But keep in mind you might want to have someone save some seats first. Especially when its busy, otherwise you might end up standing and eating. I also have to say this is a pretty nice place for get-togethers with friends.

I had the hot link sausage with sweet peppers and onions. It was amazing! The bread was soft and cradled the sausage perfectly without being under or overwhelming. We also split a small french fry. Now typically when it comes to french fries I am not a huge fan of thick cut fries, but these were perfect. Crispy, fresh, and not overly oily or potato-ey? Is that a word?

We see this place going well over 1000 reviews on Yelp soon! It's a must try for all sausage and beer lovers! OVERALL: After having this place in our bookmarks for months and with sausages that have meats like duck, rabbit, buffalo, alligator, and rattlesnake we just had to come and try this place! WHAT WE TRIED AND HOW IT TASTED: 1) BELGIAN FRIES (Small: $3.50, Large: $5.50  get the large you will thank yourself later) : SUPER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED esp. if you are enjoying a beer or three!: These fries are DEEEEELICIOUSSSS!! Try them with the Chipotle Aioli dipping sauce (our fav). These fries are thick, fried and seasoned perfectly! SO GOOD! 2) AUSTIN BLUES ($6.75): HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! We enjoy lots of flavor and spice in our sausages. This one has a great peppery taste, spicy but not too spicy, and a hint of sweetness..pork never does you wrong! 3) BUFFALO, BEEF & PORK W/ CHIPOTLE PEPPERS ($7.75): RECOMMENDED! Well compared to the Austin Blues, this one did not have as much as a robust flavor but it was still good for different reasons. It had a very meaty taste and the chipotle complimented the meats. Now if you are dying to know what buffalo tastes like, this sausage doesn't really answer the question since it just tastes like a beefy sausage! It's cool to try once, but we prefer the spicy or more flavorful sausages! 4) DUCK & BACON W/ JALAPENO PEPPERS ($7.75): This sausage was a little disappointing... couldn't really taste any duck or bacon or jalapeno. It tasted like a bland and a little-too-dry sausage really. It was fun to try once but don't think we will order this one again. It may have been bland because we were already down one Allagash White (see BEER ME! section) so maybe that affected our taste buds. BEER ME! We love the selection of beers here! Our recommendation are: 1) ALLAGASH WHITE: if you like Hoegaarden or Blue Moon or Blanche De Chambly-- we recommend this beer (one of our favs on tap). It's smooth, light tasting, slight floral and goes great with the fries or sausages! 2) KONINGS HOVEN/LA TRAPPE: At 10.5% ABV (Alcohol By Volume) you would think this beer will leave the worst after taste ever and will truly give you the bitter beer face... well you haven't tried Konings Hoven then! This is a must try for those of you who love the perfection of having high alcohol content yet still having a great taste to the beer or if you are just trying to get a fast buzz ;). SERVICE: This place is quite hip with a mid-20/early 30s staff and the customer service was excellent and very friendly. Matt the Bartender was exceptionally great in suggesting specific beers and allowing us to taste a couple before purchasing them. Now this was during lunch time so things were a little slower so don't expect to taste test all the beer on tap during the busy hours! Keep up the friendly service guys, it's much appreciated! ENVIRONMENT: Located in the Arts District of Downtown LA and a 5 minute walk to Little Tokyo, Wurstkuche is located i in a warehouse turned cute urban-chic gastropub. Spacious, plenty of seating and very clean for a sausage and beer place. SUBSTITUTE PLACE FOR ORANGE COUNTY PEOPLE: Now Downtown LA is a super fun place but with traffic and a 40+ mile drive we cannot make it out to this wonderful place all the time. When we are craving a fast sausage/ beer fix and can't make it out to LA we head on over to VALHALLA TABLE in Costa Mesa, CA (yelp.com/biz/valhalla-ta…) which is very similar but can never compare to WURSTKUCHE!

The place has blown up since then. The bratwurst is good the fries and beer are even better. The sausage links are good I just think that the buns are keeping me from giving them a better rating because they are using a real cheap high-fructose corn syrup like buns that are really fluffy in a synthetic kind of way. The fries and beer on the other hand are amazing. You better try the bleu cheese, walnut and bacon dipping sauce; there is nothing else like it! Another con is the ambiance. Its great in their despite being really crowded however once 7pm rolls around the music comes on and then everyone has to yell at each other to have a conversation. This is a major minus in my opinion. It makes you feel like your in a stupid club. To summarize , Wurstkuche should step up its game with better qualified buns, toasted buns even might be nice. Next they should lower the volume; the music is great but not when its blasting at top volume. Fix those 2 things and it would be a perfect place."},{"date":"2012-05-17","rating":"3.0","review":"I'm tempted to write \"meh\" because I feel like this place is far too hyped, and their signature dish disappoints.  The fries are good,  but the sausages are only marginally better than indifferent.  The sauces for the fries are... ok.  I like the curry ketchup, but it didn't wow me, and none of the others were great.  However the ambiance is good, when it isn't overcrowded, and the music can be exceptionally good (it's been assorted groovy electronic every time I've been there).  And the beer is fantastic.  So, despite its shortcomings, I guess it makes one of the nicer hangouts on the fringes of downtown, kind of like a Silver Lake joint in a gritty, but up and coming, neighborhood.  For a lazy Sunday afternoon, it's a good choice.  For a hectic Friday night, maybe less so."},{"date":"2012-07-24","rating":"5.0","review":"I love it.  I've been here twice; first, after discovering the wonders of the Arts District when the Gold Line opened, and the second time, I brought the folks.  My father is of German heritage and from Pennsylvania.  He is forever on a search for satisfactory German-like food, close to what his mother used to make from scratch...from plants and animals on the farm.  So, to Wurstküche we went.  Dad became interested immediately upon detection of  the umlaut.  He soon found something not only acceptable, but astonishingly good, in Wurstküche - the rattlesnake and rabbit.  This was my favorite as well (also tried the alligator & pork, and buffalo, beef & pork - 4 stars each).  Dad enjoyed that the crowd was mostly hip youngins, who were also excited about German-like food.  Mom is vegetarian, and she declared the fries \"excellent.\"Wurstküche IS excellent.  In every way."},{"date":"2010-02-07","rating":"5.0","review":"I am tempted to use a pun referring to exotic wieners and putting them in my mouth...but I'm a lady, so I'll refrain.What I will say is that if Wurstkuche was a guy, he'd be the hot new guy that all the girls wanted to take to the prom.  For realies.He's cute.  Located in a really artsy part of downtown in a really awesome building, he is so pretty, even a shallow girl like me is drawn into his looks.  He's low maintenance.  No fancy bells and whistles, no waiters, no overwrought menus.  Just sausages, beer, fries and soda.  He's simple, and direct, and I dig that. He's yummy.  And I mean that in all ways, both literal and figurative.  The rabbit sausage was amazing and delicate and the rattlesnake had bite.  The different types of mustard complimented all the different flavors AND he offers fries with truffle oil and dipping sauces (I loved the bleu cheese, bacon and walnut) Regardless of what you choose, he will leave you satisfied...THAT is rare in both men AND restaurants.And finally, he makes you feel comfortable.  And this is the best part.  You feel like you're home with him or at least you can be relaxed and yourself.  He makes you feel at ease.I'm actually excited about Wurstkuche.  I wanna introduce him to all my friends and see all the cool sausage techniques he has to offer.So basically, I wanna put all his exotic wieners in my mouth.  Sorry, guess I'm  not THAT much of a lady."},{"date":"2010-09-29","rating":"5.0","review":"Apparently the pronunciation of this place sound like 'worstcoochie' but it has the BEST SAUSAGE!!!

After a day in meetings, we leave famished and naturally stop right into here for a bite. The inside appears small, but once you order you make your way down a long hallway that opens up to a decent sized dining room. The staff is super friendly, usually with a greeter at the door handing you a menu and asking you if you need any help. The cashiers are fast and efficient. The menu is simple- all sausages. You choose toppings like onions or peppers, your sausage, and you get to top it off with a variety of mustards stationed at each table. I love the sausage selection, with both vegan and exotic offerings. I have seen rabbit, alligator, duck, and rattlesnake sausages. My favorite has been the kielbasa. They also have great french fries, the perfect pair to a sausage.Wurstküche also has a very decent craft beer selection on draft, and several craft soda options in a bottle- including my all-time favorite- Curiosity Cola from Fentimans. Your sausages are brought to your table in an industrial looking twisted metal holder that matches the metal walls. The whole dining room is stark, bare, and full of metal. Most of the tables are picnic/community style, although there are some more separated.  Overall, I have always been satisfied. Its a great spot for a quick bite and a quick beer, but I could see myself tiring of just sausages for lunch pretty soon...."},{"date":"2012-03-23","rating":"5.0","review":"I came back again last night. this place is still so good and fun and chill!Tried the rattlesnake this time- it's spicy and juicy at the same time + with some caramelized onions & spicy peppers = PERFECTION!Liter of beer?

It was super busy and very hipster, indie, whatever you want to call it. It was almost ridiculous how many people were wearing flannel.I'm not going to bother going into what I ate since I basically got the same thing - Kielbasa and Louisiana Hot Link. I did, however, try a couple new (to me) beers:-La Chouffe (golden ale - 8%)I found it very palatable, with slight floral and citric aromas and flavors. Smooth, a little spicy, but light with high drinkability.-St. Bernardus ABT 12 (quardruple -10.5%)I'm not a fan of dark beers, so I have no idea why I ordered this. It was surprisingly balanced, smooth, rich, malty, and a little fruity in flavor.An unfortunate occurrence (read: party foul) happened soon after the group sat down and started eating - my beer spilled! It got knocked over when someone was reaching for the mustard bottle. Anyhow, I was sad face status at this point, but one of the guys who works there offered to fill me back up. He said something to the effect of, \"Let me fill that up for you. You paid $8 for it, you should be able to enjoy it\". I thought that was a real stand up move on their part. He didn't have to do it, but he did. Thanks!I also recently read in my USC Alumni Association magazine that one of the co-owners is a USC alumnus. I guess that scores some bonus points in my book.

I came here with my awesome friend Cheryl T. (who I fondly refer to as Churro) and a couple of her friends about a month back. There was a line going out of the door and it was the epitome of a hipster hangout, but the food was oh so good. I mean, how could one really pass up a place that specializes in sausages and beer? Not I. I decided to skip the casualties and go for the more interesting items on the menu. Sure, I wasn't adventurous enough to try the rattlesnake or the alligator. I stuck with a safer bet with the duck and bacon sausage. So. Good. Why can't every sausage place make duck sausages? Got some Belgian fries because they are yet another weakness of mine. They were perfectly fried and come with a variety of dipping sauces. Here, I couldn't be too adventurous as I can never pass up the opportunity to try out the curry ketchup. And, of course, Wurstkuche offers an amazing selection of Belgian and German beers. If I could have tried them all, I probably would. Okay, maybe not the PBR. The beers are served in their specialty glasses. I went with the Fruili, which was very sweet, but hit the spot at the time. All in all, a fun night. My only complaint was that it was incredibly loud. I'm not sure what I expected from a hipstery spot on a Friday night, but I had to shout to have any sort of conversation.

Haha!) Wurstküche is a purveyor of flavorful, exotic grilled sausages, which are so delish that you will dream about them in your sleep! Try the rabbit and rattlesnake sausage with jalapeño peppers (my fav!), the duck & bacon sausage with jalapeño peppers, or the alligator & pork, smoked andouille sausage. If these sausages sound too exotic for your taste, the more traditional options are bratwurst, bockwurst, hot italian, chicken apple with spices, sun dried tomato with mozzarella and 12 savory others (veggie sausages included!). The crispy Belgian fries are a must try too (they are more incredible with buttermilk ranch sauce!) and the Houblan Chouffe is a yummy IPA.Wurstküche is housed in a stark, modern industrial \"warehouse\" with concrete floors and exposed brick walls. The eating area features wood communal tables and benches and the ordering area is accented with red Blu Dot Real Good chairs and barstools. During my first visit to Wurstküche, I fell in love with these chairs and bought a set to go with my dining room table at home!The only downside is the restaurant is super trendy right now. It's consistently crowded (with a line that typically spans around the block), there's always a lengthy wait for the food, and it's difficult to find a place to sit.

In the heart of Downtown L.A.'s Art District adjacent to Little Tokyo, Wurstküche (pronounced Vurst-KU-shay) is a gem tucked away in obscurity (but you won't miss it, considering the long line at its door).  Its interior has a warehouse feel and there are long tables lined up in the dining area. Its decor and food are effortlessly original and creative.Unlike your average-joe frank, it serves 3 kinds of sausages: Classics, Gourmets, and Exotics.  I always go for an exotic sausage, since I figured I wouldn't be able to have it elsewhere.  The \"duck, bacon, & jalapeño\" sausage is beyond flavorful and succulent, being quite bold and goes down well with a nice cold glass of Franziskaner ;).  The \"rattlesnake & rabbit\" is quite smooth and buttery and the \"rabbit, veal & pork w/white wine\" had a hint of sweetness.  All my sandwiches are topped with grilled onions & sweet peppers, YUM. The other choices are sauerkraut & hot peppers.To top off these awesome sausage sandwiches are 4 tasty mustards.  I go for the whole grain mustard and the honey mustard.Next up, the BELGIAN FRIES! The small size comes w/one sauce and the large comes w/two sauces. The fries are double dipped & presented chicly in a cone-like contraption.  The sauces accompanying them are brilliant and my faves are the \"ketchup curry\" and \"thai peanut.\" Oh! And don't forget a glass of La Chouffe or a bottle of Cucumber Soda!My boyfriend and I love having late dinners here cause it's a rad place to get intoxicated at!

I went to the back of the restaurant and it was packed like a massive mess hall. Everything was taken so I can back up to the front and sat at the bar. Waited some more. During my wait, I had a delightful encounter with Mike \"Hair kisses DON'T count\" C.! We talked a little bit about the food since he was just about done eating. He also asked me to be his food girlfriend. Can it get anymore romantic than that? You're awesome, Mike C.!Waited some more and finally got my food. It was definitely worth the wait! The sausage was full of flavor but it wasn't heavy. The sauerkraut was perfect with a good amount of vinegar so that it didn't take away from the taste of the sausage. The fries were ok.

When you first get in there is a counter to order your bratwurst, I knew this place had to be good when there was a line of about 10 people on a rainy  Wednesday night. Make sure you grab a menu they explain everything, pricing and topping you get 2 topping on your bratwurst, such as grilled onions, peppers etc. The bratwurst are all between $5.50-$7.50, I had 2 that were excellent, the Italian Sausage, and the Rattle snake and Rabbit, they were both amazing the toppings really make them too, if you like you food a little spicy get the peppers very good, plus I got to eat 3 different animals in one seating, its always nice to be reminded that we are top of the food chain. They have some great filling fries too shared the larger size with my partner in crime Joe R. we didn't even finish them but they were great, you get two dipping sauces, I went with the sun dried tomatoes, recommended to me by Natalia R. good call, and a chipotle sauce also very tasty.     If you are planning on getting drunk drink before you go here, the beers are delicious but they are all priced between $7.25-$11, which is well worth the price, since their beers are amazing, I had 6 different beers all amazing, but if you drink 6 beers at this place, it can get pricey. To the credit of their beer menu, it list all of their beers if they have them on draft, they must have at least 20 different beers on draft, and a few other in bottles, but the menu explains what price, alcohol content, where its from, and the size of the beers. The higher alcohol beers come in smaller glasses. I recommend, the La Chouffe, actually anything that has Chouffe in it is good, and if you like Guinness try the Rasputin, surprisingly very good.    Also the crowd is very cool and friendly the have a few large tables were everyone sits next to each other, and they have a few tables that  you could have a little more privacy. They have a large bar in the seating area. I highly recommend this place, it can get pricey, so drink first and a enjoy a couple premium beers here.

For a popular place the sausages ranged from 6 - 7.50...I think that's really reasonable if you compare it to the Tijuana dogs for $3.50 found on LA streets. For a few dollars more you can taste alligator, rattlesnake, rabbit, duck, veal etc. Great price, indeed! Oh whatt to choose, what to choose...I ordered Bitburger beer and duck and bacon sausage. The hubby went for alligator and rabbit sausage and Allagash beer. We also ordered the twice fried belgian fries with aioli dipping sauce. The hubby really dug the vibe of the place...it's a modern beer hall vibe if you ask me, and the bar looked amazing offering Belgian beers on tap including Chimay. All in all, the sausages are flavorful and amazing. One thing I do recommend is to not douse your food with the condiments..if you want to taste alligator or rabbit...do not drown it in ketchup. If you do that your exotic flavored sausage will just taste like any other sausage from your local supermarket.By the time we left Wurstkuche, the line was out the door...this place does seem to have a following.

So popular that the first time we tried to come here, there were 50-60 people waiting in line OUTSIDE the building. Concert status. NO food is that good, FYI. Ya'll are crazy.I think with that amount of people, this place is raking in the $$$ and they should expand. Either buy a new building somewhere nearby or make a second location.And I'm not knocking how delicious this place is - I'd definitely go back!

I've been looking forward to trying Wurstkuche for a long time... Unfortunately my wife is vegetarian, so the chances don't come up too often.  Fortunately saw that they had vegetarian options, so gave it a try last night.Overall a pretty good meal.  The sausages were decent.  I had the rattlesnake, as well as the mango one.  Nothing to rave about.  What was probably the better portion of the meal were the fries and the dipping sauces, and of course the crazy amount of choices of beer... ranging as low as $2.50 up to $250 if you can believe it.  Parking sucks, as does trying to get a table.  We went when it was relatively quieter.  It was colder outside so you constantly had people coming around to see if you were going to leave.  They seemed to have thought that the Father's Office model of fighting for tables is a good thing...

Unfortunately, like people, restaurants change, and it's not always for the better. The sausages have shrunk to minuscule proportions, the veggie offerings have never been good (but I guess that goes without saying... just throwing that in), and the last two times I've gone there I'm less and less happy. This used to be a really good place; I really did love it... but if I pay 8 dollars for a sausage, I don't really consider how \"exotic\" it is if it's the same size as your standard BAR-S hot dog.  This is a sausage, a kielbasa, a bratwurst!! These names imply a certain something that is sticking out of each side of a standard sized bun and would NEVER allow you to CLOSE the bun up and hide the entire girth of the sausage. I don't know what else I have to say other than that. The flavors are still pretty good, but the high bread ratio definitely puts a damper on that.The Belgian Fries are still excellent, and the blue cheese walnut dip I would buy and take home. I'm not a beer guy either, but I did taste one here once that was actually tasty... so take that into account. I still really like their apple pie ice cream sandwiches a ton too. The thing for me is that the sausage is the feature here, and it fails... now anyway.I've also come to be totally irked by this awful awful thing about food inconsistency I see these days. This totally bleeds deep into my review. It's one thing to have started out all along with these little fancy dogs and big buns, but like a relationship, when you come to love this wonderful person, then stick around to watch them turn into this somber, lesser version of their former self, the separation is that much more painful. I'd rather they raise the price a dollar or two and keep the sausages at sausage size rather than have half a sausage for 8 bucks. Maybe they took the bigger sausages to the new location that they opened in SM, but I don't know what happened here.I have a few friends who still enjoy it and suggest it now and again, so I'll be back, but they'll hear my griping and I'll end up spending $15 for two sausages instead of just one (I've been staying away from fries lately).2.5 stars."},{"date":"2013-12-18","rating":"5.0","review":"Amazing spot good hot dogs good beers friendly staff"},{"date":"2012-01-26","rating":"5.0","review":"Wait a second, excuse me?

They have apple beer, strawberry beer and raspberry beer that tastes like JUICE, I kid you not. Yummy. Had the best time here and there was a live DJ on Saturday night playing THE best music.

Highly recommended. As a gastropub, the beer selection is excellent, particularly for Belgian and German brews.  Exotic sausage made from rattlesnake and rabbit with jalapeno served in a bun topped with caramelized onions and sweet peppers - simply mouthwatering. Belgian fries with curry ketchup - delightfully appetizing.2 -3 vegetarian sausage options were available, although we opted for the meat links.Some German characteristics: Seating included mostly picnic benches consistent with the German biergarten style, large Spaten steins, and the availability of Underberg digestifs.As mentioned above, it appears this place gets packed on weekend nights.

And pretty unique, well lit, and really nice for a nice but casual dinner out with your friends and your date. You walk through to see brick walls and order at the front. Then you can move towards the back where they have a lot of wooden, long tables and chairs and an awesome bar. The ambience is NOT like any other ordinary hotdog joint. I ordered mango and jalapeno hotdog, while my friends ordered kielbasa and my roomie got rattlesnake and rabbit- yes. Snake and rabbit in a dog, everyone. They have all sorts of funky hotdogs- duck and bacon, buffalo, pork, beef, alligator... every edible animal possible. It's cray, and I don't really know how they tasted, but seeing my roomie's expression I'm sure the food was dabombDOTcom. With your hotdog you get 2 toppings, ranging from caramelized onions to spicy peppers- I got caramelized onions and sauerkraut on mine, which were both very very good. The dog comes on a pretty awesome hotdog bun, too- soft, but slightly toasted crunchy, just the way I like it. My roomie also ordered belgian fries, which were nice and crispy and yummm-ay. I think I'll be getting some next time I visit. It comes with curry ketchup- the flavor here could have been maybe better...? I feel like it lacks a tiny bit of flavor.They also boast a TON of types of mustards- spicy, normal, honey mustard, etc. It's fun to try them on your hotdog with each bite you take, which I loved. Reasons why I gave it 4 stars1. I only tried one of their dog so I'd like to come back some other time to try others, see if they're all good2. I WANT TO TRY THE BELGIAN/GERMAN BIERS.

It was juicer than the other sausages, especially the Exotic ones. The double dipped fries are a must, get it with the white truffle glaze. The two sauces I recommended is the blue cheese and the chipotle aioli. For drinks, I normally get the Spaten Optimator, its a nice strong tasting beer. Definitely worth 6 dollars. I normally get it in the 1 liter Stein. Just double the price of the 1/2 liter. They'll hold your card (which they didn't do before), but its fine, because I normally open a tab. It might be a hassle for some people, but there's something enjoyable about cheering among your friends with a stein in your hand. Finding seats could be difficult, especially for large groups.

Good luck on the street, you may be parking BLOCKS from the place, even on a SUNDAY!You will encounter a LINE DOWN THE STREET on what appears to be ANY given day! Be prepared to stand in line with LA's trendiest and freest people.

So it you didn't brush up on their stock, the waitress will be happy to suggest something for you (as she did me)!Then you will get a long paper menu and start attempting to make sense of it all: you have to pick a HOTDOG, then choose TWO toppings, if you want the BELGIAN FRIES, you may pick from additionally priced dipping sauces.

We had to stand in line for quite a while, but at least it was well worth it for Beers, Sausages and Belgian fries not a stupid club! I thought the beers were a tad overpriced, but the sausages are priced really well. I split the Austin Blue sausage and the green chili and cilantro sausage with a friend. We got caramelized onions and peppers on both and slapped on some spicy mustard. I liked the Austin Blue one best. I liked the Belgian fries here better than the rendition at the Oinkster in Eagle Rock. I also liked that there was a plethora of dipping sauces and aioli's to select from. The place was crowded but we were able to easily find a table for our party of 6! The staff was hustling and our food came out pretty darn fast. The music the DJ was spinning was all over the place, but in a good way, it had me moving in my seat. The best thing about Wurstkuche is that they have mastered the perfect bun to sausage ratio!

The sausages are tasty and creative, and it's worth trying several different ones (or maybe just a bite of a friend's), some just to say you've eaten that ingredient. Be careful with the toppings, and be sure to taste the dog without, since they can greatly mask or enhance flavors. They have a fairly wide selection of some very good beers, and the fries and sauces are nice, too. On the positive side, the food is delicious. At heart it's simple comfort food: beer, french fries and sausage (albeit with very exotic ingredients, so that hipsters feel good about dropping a wad on a day's worth of pure carbs). On the negative side, it's mostly unhealthy, expensive, ordinary hunks of starch and meat, so that you won't want to eat here often. Seating is mostly at long shared tables. You might think you'd meet people that way, but it actually just spreads people thin and it's often so loud you can't hear the person in your own group two seats down anyway.There's no lot, but street parking within a block or so usually isn't hard on the east side of downtown, which is good because it's a bad neighborhood."},{"date":"2012-11-11","rating":"5.0","review":"Awesome sausages, Belgian fries, and various German/Belgian beers!I came here once a couple years back, and revisited it recently with my cousins.I got the Alligator and Pork sausage with caramelized onions and sweet peppers, Belgian fries (with Curry Ketchup and Chipotle Aioli), and a Bitburger (pilsner).

I came here with my girlfriend and I immediately saw the long line coming out the door. Quickly I learned what the place was about and I fell in love again.This is how it works: Step 1: Arrive and stand in line.Step 2: Order your beer while your waiting in line from the waitress walking around taking beer orders.Step 3: Arrive at the counter and order your sausage. (I recommend the Rabbit Snake Sausage - it's exceptional!)Step 4: Walk to the cafeteria tables and sit down and place your number on the table.Step 5: Wait with your guest(s) and have a good conversation, while enjoying your beer.Step 6 (Optional): Make friends with the neighbors next to you (you know the ones your brushing shoulders with) or your neighbors on the other side of the table.Step 7: Enjoy the food, which I have to say is DIVINE!

But honestly I couldn't tell the difference between the two or even a regular hot dog. I think its just a overpriced gourmet hotdog.So after you order you go look for a spot to sit at. Its like a cafeteria where you have to find your own seat. When busy please avoid. It took me almost 30 mins to find a seat. People would not leave after they were done eating. Another annoying part was the sauces that are shared between everyone wasn't enough. There just wasn't enough bottles for everyone. The table besides us had to reach over and ask us if they could \"borrow it\". Excuse me I was using that too. You can wait your turn.Anyways, the staff was great but the food and seating wasn't.

Prices range from 5.75 for the \"Classics\" to 7.50 for the \"Exotic\" sausages. So I decided to go with something tame but I thought would give me a great idea of what they had, so I came out with the Duck and Bacon, two of my favorite fatty foods. I also ordered an order of the \"Groot\" or Large Fries and a Ginger Beer (they have 26 Drafts; Belgium/German/US; and 17 Bottled from the same). All in all a great sausage, just what I thought it would taste like and the Ginger Beer was perfect to cut the fat of the sausage. The Fries were also good, served with a blue cheese dip and a spicy I-don't-know-wha-kinda sauce. It kinda reminded me of Father's Office with the feel of the design, but with a Bavarian Twist. I'd come back here with friends, they have plenty of seating inside and out, but you might spend some time circling the block to get free parking like you would in Venice, otherwise there's tons of meters.Enjoy!"},{"date":"2011-01-29","rating":"4.0","review":"Now when you have meat in encased form, I will be there.

And although I was expecting to come here for lunch, I didn't expect it to be where it is and what the experience would be like. Lucky for my lunch buddy an d me, it was definitely a pleasant surprise for the both of us. If you've never been here, there is a random door in the middle of this huge reddish wall that has \"Wurstkuche\" written above it. Going in, there's a counter/kitchen area with a glass compartment on the left with a variety of sausages. Just make yourself cozy in line for a little bit and decide what you want from their slender tan menu. Once you pay, just mosie on down this random hall  on the right past the glass sausage compartment all the way down to the end where you'll find a grand dining hall. It looks like a trendy, bar-like cafeteria. There's beer on tap along the wall. There's also a patio area out back if you're the outdoorsy kind. Now what to order. I stumbled upon this dilemma and I tell ya, I'm thankful for the somewhat long wait in line. I was recommended the RATTLESNAKE AND RABBIT SAUSAGE and I got it with carmelized onions and sauerkraut. YUM! A hint of spiciness adds a kick to this wild dog. The bread roll reminded me of sourdough bread (it probably is) because it's soft, warm, and crunchy. The BELGIAN FRIES are a must. I highly recommend getting the CHIPOTLE AIOLI sauce. It might have been the fact that we got the aioli with the somewhat mediocre BBQ sauce, but the chipotle aioli just tasted fantastic!The prices weren't to bad. The dogs hovered between $6-8 and the fries were $3.75 for the large. I also heard the apple beer is delish. This place looks like their beer would be good. Parking is street and metered, but the grand thing about it is on certain streets, you can pay $4 at the meter for 10 hours worth of parking!

By the outside photos I thought this place was a friday's, but i was wrong.It was a pretty popular place, given there was a small line.As far as the food, I ordered the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage, the spicy italian vegetarian sausage, and fries w/ thai peanut dipping sauce. If I could describe the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage I'd say that it tasted similar to gyro lamb meat. it was good. The spicy italian was also good, but i'd categorize it as a medium/hot on the spicy scale. The description of this place was to the effect that the sausages were exotic sausages served on bread. The sausages were exotic, but the bread was pretty much like a hotdog bun.The fries were fresh and the dipping sauce was yum.The selection of beers was impressive. I don't know if some of the orders were for a keg or if they were single pours or what, but some selections were rather pricey. I'm talking like $90 and $250 for an order. I didn't choose anything near that range, but tried a Belgium called La Chouffe. It was okay but my friends made got a Spaten Optimator (which was more my taste) and a Blanche De Bruxelles (my taste too, and I ended up getting a round of that).The interior was modern and efficient.

I ended up getting the kielbasa with caramelized onions and sauerkraut. It was good, juicy and flavorful.The other people in my group tried their exotics: alligator & pork and the rattlesnake & rabbit. Both said the rattlesnake & rabbit tasted better than the alligator one. I will definitely give that a try some time in the future. Food was good that night, but it was something about the lighting that gave me a headache. Why was it so dark anyway? Maybe it was just me. Anyway, we left around 9 and the line was still pretty long.Second time coming here with another friend, she loved the rattlesnake & rabbit! And I finally got to try the mango jalapeno. It was good, but not great. We also got a Belgian fries to share, it was way too salty imo. Friend also got the Floris Apple Ale, basically beer with apple flavor. Sadly, I think that was the best part of the lunch. Would definitely recommend this for girls that doesn't usually like beer. It's almost like a apple-flavored soda lol. Anyway, since I came here during daytime on a weekday. Lighting was def not a problem. No headaches or anything. It wasn't crowded at all. Had a great time catching up with my friend and it was much better than my first experience. Will definitely come back!Oh, btw, be careful where you park. This is downtown after all. I parked right next to the apartment complex both times. And if there's a meter, DO NOT forget to feed it from time to time if you're staying for long.

I met up with Nacho and some pals from school and also made some new friends after a Chimay and a Rattlesnake & Rabbit sausage with Jalapeño Peppers, Plus a side of double dipped Belgian Fries.I actually thought the Rattlesnake was going to be gamey, but to my surprise it was well balanced with the flavors of the rabbit... thanks to the bunny flavor to enhance the snake. Yummy!Their selections of beers are amazing. Belgium beers are truly my favorite.. but you do need to pace yourself with these types of beers.Their menu is pretty wacky here...

A great way to commemorate a wonderful night. Found out last night that a big party can be had at Wurstkuche, as long as you're willing to endure the stinkeyes of those around you.Basically, they take a 6pm and an 8pm reservation a night, and the vast majority of your party needs to be there or else they'll give your table away to the other ravenous weiner-eaters waiting for a seat. I understand this logic: If I had just ordered my duck and bacon sausage and was wandering around for a seat, I would not appreciate a group of five sitting around a table for 30. So if you make a reservation, make sure to tell everyone to get there at least 30 minutes ahead of time. Also, this was the first time I came here on a Saturday and it was insanely packed, the line to order snaking down the block. Luckily our group was patient and we all ended up getting our food eventually, but it took a while. Very different on weeknights!That being said, huge props to Travis, the reservations guy - he was amazing and helpful and really helped us have a great time. He even gave the birthday boy in our party a free beer mug, although it got cleared by an unknowing busser and was lost forever. Tonight I tasted the rattlesnake and rabbit (amazeballs) and ordered the duck and bacon (also delish). I still haven't hit my stride with the dipping sauces, but I liked the bleu cheese walnut. 30 friends, some Delirium, a weiner and some birthday cake - basically the best night i've had in a while.

Don't get upset if it takes 10 mins to find a table. They have wide variety of sausages and beer which is great because they go great together. I ordered a Mango Jalapeno and a Louisiana Hot Link. I ordered both spicy Peppers and the onions. Delicious! Went great La Trappe (beer) which is gone by the end of my first hot =T I also tried like La Chouffe which felt pretty light so I would prefer that one with the sausages.

My guess is unless you pick one with heavy spices, you won't be able to tell what the meat is at all (so go for the exotic ones!)Wasn't diggin the sauerkraut though-- very tart, and not much flavor.

Really, Wurstküche is that place you bring a girl to.

Hmm? HMM?) with caramelized onions and sweet peppers on it, and it was, as they say in German and in Dutch, \"lekker\".  Plus, bun was toasted just right, the whole thing wasn't too big, and they had a bunch of sexy-looking indie sodas that I didn't try.  My friends (can you believe it?!) and I split an order of the \"Belgian\" fries, which were, admittedly incredibly delicious, but also admittedly, certainly not actually Belgian style.  I get the idea: keep it all in the same vein, and they're certainly running their own take on wurst, but Belgian Fries are a pretty specific thing, so maybe just call them fries, or at least make them standardly come with mayo and/or frites oorlog sauce on the side.  \"Haley, stop being a self-righteous hipster.\"  \"Ok, sorry.\" The curry ketchup was \"mad\" authentic, though.\"Seriously, stop.\"\"Fine.  The People's Court is on now, anyway.\"So, overall, really, really cool place, plenty of seating, friendly staff, etc.  If the wurst and the creativity of the wurst weren't so damned good I'd take off a point for prices, but the quality of the experience makes it more than worth it.One last thing: we carpooled down from Los Feliz, but once we got down there, we realized that the Little Tokyo metro stop is like one block from the restaurant, so I'd recommend doing that for anyone planning to check it out.  If I'd have known that I definitely would have scrapped the drive."},{"date":"2012-08-20","rating":"5.0","review":"OH MY GAAAAAD.Had the sun dried tomato and mozzarella sausage with onions and sweet peppers.  Shared the large fries with companion and got it with the truffle oil, side dipping sauce was the bleu cheese, walnut and bacon and ranch (I didn't pick the ranch, oh well).  Died and went to heaven.  Washed it down with a delicious beer called Franziskaner, friend got an equally delicious Spaten Optimator to wash down his mango jalapeno sausage with onions and spicy peppers.Needless to say we were both equally pleased and the only complaint I have is that I live in Lakewood and this place isn't close enough for me to eat at EVERY DAMN DAY OF MY LIFE.Also, this seems to be the super secret spot in LA where you actually can find plenty of parking on the streets without having to pay a meter or pay in an overpriced lot.  Extra bonus points.  We went here on a Sunday and probably met up around 7:30ish, seriously, it was PERFECT TIMING because as soon as we lined up to place our order there was a shit ton of people and a line way out the door.  I definitely recommend coming a little earlier rather than later to get your fix.Genießen sie ihr essen!!!"},{"date":"2010-08-12","rating":"5.0","review":"My friend took me here one day for dinner and I had the best sausage I've had in a while.

You'll find the entrance to the place on Traction. If you see a line out the door, that's most definitely going to be the place. Before getting in line, look for one of the workers near the entrance for a menu. This way while you're waiting in line you'll have what you want down.The menu is simple. Sausages (classic, gourmet, and exotic), toppings, fries, and drinks. Bada bing bada boom. The end :] Now with all the options it can make deciding for just one difficult. I'd recommend if you're with a pretty decent sized group, grab a little bit of everything and share. On this visit my friends and I ordered and Mango Jalapeno, Sun Dried Tomato & Mozz, Rattlesnake & Rabbit w/ Jalapeno, a Duck & Bacon w/ Jalapeno (if you couldn't tell we all LOVE spicy food) and a Groot (large order Belgium fries). Everything we ordered was super delicious. Very juicy and had that nice \"snap\" when you bit into the sausage. No one flavour out shined the other and there was a good balance. The duck & bacon one though was much richer than the others. Once you place your order, grab your number and head back to the seating area. You have a closed off room to your left as you turn the corner to the dining area, a common dining area with long picnic tables, and outdoor seating. Take your pick. Whatever you choose, the tables will come with large squeeze bottles filled with different types of mustard and ketchup.The atmosphere is super fun and casual. I also noticed they have turn tables.

They have pilsners, belgium glasses and large mugs to properly serve the biers.Suggestion if you haven't been yet.  Go with a bunch of friends you will have a great time."},{"date":"2009-11-02","rating":"4.0","review":"A good friend suggested this place. Totally hidden but well worthwhile. I tried the mango jalapeno grilled sausage topped with peppers and onions. Soooo good!

Other friends also tried the filipino marharlika, austin blues, and rattlesnake/rabbit with jalapeno peppers. Two thumbs up for all! As far as beers go, I'd have to say my faves of the night were Floris Apple Ale (sweet and light, super delicious!), Koestritzer Schwarzbier (dark and sweet), and Scheider Edel Weisse (light and tea-like).

Anyways, I ordered the Filipino Maharlika which was more of the sweeter sausage.  Mind you, I can barely pronounce half of the items on the menu, let alone write it with correct spelling.  But yes, this place offers exotic meats like alligator, rattlesnakes, etc, which I'm sure I'll try one of these days.  I have to admit the sausage was delicious.  Very flavorful.  I ordered the Belgium fries along with the Thai peanut sauce to dip it with and I wasn't blown away, but I heard from another coworker that I should try it with the truffle oil instead.  All in all, it was an expensive lunch.  18 bucks to be exact, which includes my drink.   I'm all for expensive lunches as it was work my buck (flavorful, tasty, and got me full), but I'm sad to say, I can't make this a daily habit or I'm sure to go broke.  But I'm determined to come back to try their more exotic menu and I'm pretty sure I'll come out a happy camper."},{"date":"2012-08-15","rating":"4.0","review":"Great sausage selection most with great taste and texture.

There is a great selection of Belgian and German beer, as well as a good bit of non-alcoholic (and non-traditional) drinks, although the non-alcoholic drinks are expensive for what they are.

On top of waiting for 15 minutes to scout out seating, 2 people got their food. We stood and ate. Again, not the restaurants fault.When we sat down after waiting forever, my buddy and I dug into our delicious looking sausages. We both took bites of each others and for the life of us could not tell the difference. I liked the gameness of the food but since both exotic meats were together, it was hard to differentiate.

There's one cash register when you order in front, and it's typically operated by a nice but slow, person.

Putting aside the annoying task of finding parking and the semi-long line, everything was great. I got the bratwurst with caramelized onions and sauerkraut on top with a side of belgian fries and tzatziki dipping sauce. And a Bitburger beer to go with my meal (I asked the servers what they recommend with my choice of bratwurst and they were very helpful). Everything was just right. The bratwurst had just the right amount of seasonings and was complemented really well by the toppings (they also have peppers as a choice). And the fries with the sauce were heaven. I also tried the chipotle aioli and that was good as well. And as the beer goes you can go with Birburger, their delicious strawberry beer or one of the other 20+ beers they have available.We wait in line, ordered at a small counter, and then made our way down a long hallway only to be greeted by a German-style hall sitting area. Basically, long wooden tables with long benches. Sit where you can find a spot and socialize with those at your table. Great way to meet people! Unfortunately for us every table inside was taken so we sat on the patio where it was just as nice but not as sociable. Overall a great experience and I would definitely return.

At first I hadn't even realized we'd arrived. The place is a bit inconspicuous from the outside, but I guess that's what adds to the appeal. Ordering is pretty straight forward, you pick your sausage, your brew and you head to the dining area and wait for your food. The dining area is reminiscent of a German beer garden with long wooden tables. There's also a bar serving up all varieties of beer. It's a trendy scene at Wurstküche; an artist crowd and lots of hipsters. It works considering it's right in LA's art district.I decided to go with a bratwurst with onion and sauerkraut. It was delicious, as I expected it would be. Everything tasted really fresh and it was made by someone who really seems to care about food. All very good things when eating at a restaurant.

You can't go wrong with a goblet of a Trappist beer like the Chimay White or the La Trappe. If I think I did well on the test, I'll be sure to get a liter of one of their twenty-four Belgian, German, or North American beer on tap to celebrate! And if I think I bombed the exam, then I'll definitely be sure to get a liter of one of their twenty-four beers on tap to drown my sorrows away! But of course that's not the best part about this place.  If you're coming here, then trying one of their exotic sausages is a must.  Whether it be the buffalo, duck, rabbit, alligator, or my personal favorite rattlesnake, you're in for a well-defined gamey treat.  Of course the other sausages such as the Bratwurst, Keilbasa, or Hot Link is good too, but what's the fun of playing it safe and not being a little adventurous.On your sausages you can choose two toppings out of the caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, and spicy peppers.  Any combination works.  You can request them to put everything if you want, but the reason I think they tell you to only select two is so that the toppings and condiments don't overwhelm the taste of your sausage.  I used to make that mistake.Still hungry? But not quite sure you want another sausage? Get an order of the Belgian fries with the Chipotle Aioli dip. The dipping sauce is absolutely amazing.The staff here is friendly and the way the tables are set up allows for you to mingle with your neighbors if you so desire.  Since this is a German Gastropub, I stopped by today to see if there was any special beers they were having to celebrate Oktoberfest.  Nothing noticeably different with the selections today.  I'll be sure to stop by again and check it out a little later in the month.

There's a very vibrant and bustling vibe in the place, and the buzz of people and mixture of sounds and conversation make it an exciting and casual place to have food. There's also a long bar area that you can sit at  Efficiency - The service is smart and fast. There's a person who mans the line and is there solely to get the line moving. We had our alcoholic beverages in our hands before we even got to the register to say our orders. I liked that.   Customer Service - Quick and efficient, and friendly.. This is a really unique place that seems to fit best for the 21-30something year old who just wants to have good conversations over some good beer and good food. It's an interesting place, since even after ordering and having your food, you are left with the feeling that there are many more selections that you have yet to try (but want to come back to try). Just a tip - I found that the spicy peppers ended up overpowering the sausage. So, a tip would be to settle on toppings that are a little more subtle so that you can get a better taste of it. The taste of the sausage was diluted when we paired it with the spicy peppers. It was a bad call on our part because we didn't have a chance to get the full affect of the rabbit and duck sausage that we ordered. Belgian fries were good, though. It had a creamy texture to it. Another tip - The Floris Apple Ale was delicious. Served in a small goblet with a pinkish color to it, it had a delicious and sweet taste to it that would probably go with a person who has a lighter palette. I'll come back and try more things next time :)"},{"date":"2009-09-15","rating":"4.0","review":"Came for my friend's birthday. Pause. Plenty of weiners for everyone. Pause.

Topped off with caramelized onions *drool* and peppers it tastes really good. Makes you almost forget the fact that its a rabbit in a rattlesnake. The beer selection there is great too.

I've been looking forward to coming here and even though had crazy expectations was STILL impressed!! Don't be turned off by the hard to find location, it's close to Zip's sushi and there's a gang of security-on-bikes going around patrolling. The first thing I saw about Wurstkuche were the simple Ikea-esque letters...and a tiny door frame in a brick wall with tons of people lining up. The ordering \"room\" is small, with an area for quick eaters I guess but the menu is great!I got me some Chimay blue, always yummy and complemented that with the rattlesnake sausage and the buffalo sausage. All with onions and peppers. Oh and belgian fries, a large order of which comes with two...unique...sauces. But we'll get to that later.I wonder who ever thought of putting rattlesnake and rabbit together?! It's like once upon a time some guy found killed a snake, found a rabbit in it's gut and decide to grind it all up...then slather it with mustard and onions. That's the kind of genius that makes this world go 'round. Rattlesnake was...lemony, kind of light and a little bit spicy. It was good...but in my opinion nothing compared tooo BUFFALO. Mmm this was so delicious, all buffalo and beef and RED-red meat ground up together. Add on onions and sweet peppers, some dijon mustard and take that with some dark beer...a perfect meal. Oh wait, there's also the FRIES!Absolutely cannot forget the golden, crisp, soft, belgian fries that come with such interesting sauces...like curry ketchup, or pesto mayo. I don't even remember which ones I tried but they were all so good. It was all food-euphoria in that downstairs, huge dining room that has a bar for those why-the-hell-not moments.

Blown.The different varieties of sausages and beers are always great! I especially love ordering a GROOT sized order of pomme frites, with the curry ketchup and garlic aioli sauces. They don't just have exotic sausages if you're not in to that type of thing--they have more plain options like a regular hot dog or bratwursts, too.At first, walking in Wurstküche appears a tiny place to eat at, until you realize that the brick-wall corridor leads to a much larger seating area, complete with bar and DJ stage. There's also an outdoor patio with a decent view of downtown and the surrounding restaurants and businesses. Awesome sunsets whilst enjoying a beer and wurst has been had numerous times.I always ask friends if they've ever been here before, and always try to get them to go if they have not, just so I can tag along and get my fill."},{"date":"2011-09-06","rating":"5.0","review":"I was on the orange line going home from Midway when I noticed a piece of paper on one of the seats.  Intrigued, I picked up the piece of paper and noticed it was a menu for a place called Wurstkuche.  I read over the menu w/ interest as I'm a fan of encased meats and tasty beer and I immediately resolved to visit the place as soon as possible.  I then looked at the address and my heart sank - the place was located in Los Angeles.  Go figure.Fast forward a few months and I'm in LA.  Guess where I end up going?If you haven't already heard/read, Wurstkuche is an amazingly fun and tasty place to be.  The space itself is really nicely designed with communal tables and individual booths for those of you who like your own personal space.  There is a full stocked bar in the back which freely serves the awesome beers I mentioned.  It's a big, expansive eating area and the energy is vibrant and solid.  It's a great (European) dining experience.The sausages are winners.  Look, I'm from Chicago and I know my encased meats.  Wurstkuche is the real deal.  I had the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers and the Louisiana Hot Link  - both #!&%ing delicious and worth every mile I traveled to put these creations in my mouth.  I'm sure the other selections are just as good.  If I were given the opportunity and stomach capacity, I would try them all in one go.The beers are also top notch.  I had the Floris Apple Ale and that alone was great but coupled that w/ a spicy sausage, it's a combination worth noting.  Going back to the sausages - the Rattlesnake & Rabbit wasn't as spicy as I had imagined but the Louisiana Hot Link was right on the mark.  If you're in the market for a hot and spicy piece of sausage, that is the proper choice for you.By all means get the fries with the truffle oil.  Don't even think about it.  Just do it.I was/am so impressed with Wurstkuche, I picked up a spare menu and left it on the orange line when I was going back home from Midway.  Hopefully someone else will notice it and discover the magic that is Wurstkuche."},{"date":"2014-09-04","rating":"4.0","review":"Great food and ambience!..

Did that stop me from enjoying it? No, not at all.Here's some tips to avoid confusion when you get there. You order at the counter that you see when you enter. There are different toppings you can choose for the sausages and different sauces you can choose for the fries. You can order beer there, too. Or you can go around the corner and order beer at the bar section. Water is in a silver cooler; you can serve yourself. The water is cucumber flavored. The tables in the main section are like long picnic tables, sit where you can find a spot. There are also circular tables on the sides.Sharing with friends, cutting up the sausages in threes so as to try all of them - Yes.Fries with truffle oil & ranch dressing - Yes. Rattlesnake sausage - Yes, very goodAlligator sausage - No for me, too spicy and \"gamey\". Mike L used that term so I will imitate him here.Sun dried tomato chicken sausage - Yeah, but I might not order it again. It's good though.The wait time was slightly longer than I expected and it did get louder towards the end of our dinner but part of that means the place is well liked. I could see why.P.S.

Environment inside is like a cafeteria and they serve you your dog. I enjoy it here and it's a chill place to eat and have a beer or few.

Huge selection of sausages: everything from rabbit to veal, rattlesnake to alligator, but also serve straight-forward classics like chicken, turkey, pork, polish sausages, etc.As soon as we got there, an employee offered to get us drinks while we waited in line to order. They have a nice selection of beer to choose from and will be happy to help you out if you're not sure what to order. The staff was friendly and helpful in a non-douchey way, even when they were slammed on a Saturday night.What we ordered:**Sun-dried tomato&mozzarella chicken sausage (you get a choice of sauerkraut, sweet onions, sweet bell peppers, or spicy peppers on all the brats): good for if you want to play it safe.**Duck&bacon sausage: BY FAR my favorite sausage on the menu, and for those of you that think it's sicky-sicky gnar-gnar in the wurst (get it) way possible, it's just like a more flavorful chicken sausage - smoky, meaty heaven.**Fries: ABSOLUTE MUST! Upgrade them with the white truffle oil, it's $2 extra and worth every broke college student penny. You get a choice of 2 house-made dipping sauces which are all mucho delicious-o; my favorites are the blue cheese-walnut, the pesto mayo, and the chipotle aioli.Aside from the food, the ambience and scene is awesome. They have a DJ, full bar, and a patio. Inside, there's big tables & benches w/ community-style seating or smaller tables around the perimeter, if you're looking for something more intimate.

I also ordered the mango jalapeno hot dog with caramalized onion and spicy peppers and an order of the belgian fries($5.50). We got the sweet and sassy bbq and the pesto mayo to dip, but i just used ketchup because I dont really enjoy thick and rich sauces. The mango jalapeno dog was pretty good. It was a mixture of chicken & turkey and had a hint of sweetness and a kick of spice. I had to subtract one star because the dining area had music playing so loud it was nearly impossible to talk or hear the people you're eating with. Overall its a cool, hipster, and modern hangout.

Chicken, cows, pigs, and the occasional duck are frequent visitors to my digestive track. I even enjoy less-enthused body parts like cow tripe and chicken feet.But nothing I do can rival my father's adventurous appetite. The man watched a bat vs. snake throw down in a restaurant in Vietnam and then ATE THEM BOTH. I'm not talking about a peppered fillet served with garlic-sauteed Chanterelle mushrooms. No. The animal handler/cook chopped the heads off of each creature in the middle of the restaurant, drained their warm bloods into respective chilled beer mugs, served their plump hearts on a cocktail dish, and then fired up the grill for some bat and snake barbecue. My third grade self will never be able to unsee my mom's enthusiastic tourist pictures of their unique dining experience.This minor childhood trauma induced by my father thus inspired me to test my taste buds with rattlesnake. How Freudian of me.Friends and I made our way to downtown L.A.'s arts district to uncover Wurstküche. The loosely Central Europe eatery is best described as a small warehouse turned hipster-influenced gastropub furnished with barn ware. Think: German yokel. The dimly lit room is occupied by three long communal picnic tables and benches, flanked by small tables on the outskirts, and finished with a beer bar on one side. There is a separate, bright room in the back to order food. A delightful fedora-festooned man shuffled us into the surprisingly long line for it being 10:30 PM.I had already Yelped Wurstküche and had my mouth set for the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage with Belgian fries and a cool pint of Old Rasputin. However, I hadn't anticipated the lack of seating. I felt like a desperate vulture waiting to swoop on an opening at any of the trough-like tables. Annoyingly, our food arrived before my bird of prey instinct could kick in. But once we finally snagged a section of bench, I was not disappointed.Served in a generic hot dog bun, the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage was zestfully juicy and mildly spicy. I ordered it with yellow bell peppers and grilled jalapenos which added the perfect combination of sweetness and heat. A conservative squirt of ketchup gave a much appreciated tangy kick. The Belgian fries were thick and not as crispy as I had hoped but they were decent when accompanied by any of the four dipping sauces we ordered.My glass of Old Rasputin was the only letdown. First of all, it had a head that simply would not die. A lack of beer-pouring ability at a German gastropub? Blasphemy I say! Secondly, it was much too dark for my liking. The bitter taste bud receptors on the back of my tongue protested thoroughly until I chased it away with a bite of rattlesnake, a fry drenched in buttermilk ranch.

However, seating gets pretty tough as it's usually pretty crowded whenever I come here with friends. The tables are also arranged in long rows so you end up sitting with strangers (if you can find seating, that is).

Virtually no line.. maybe because it was Mother's day? *Kielbasa - juicy and nice texture*Rabbit and Rattlesnake - according to my friend, it tasted good and was a bit chewy*Belgian fries with Chipotle Ketchup and Tomato Mayo -  Delicious! Double-fried, thick, and crispy. I liked the tomato mayo dip a lot. The chipotle ketchup wasn't bad, but it kind of just tasted like ketchup with some sriracha sauce added to it*Früli (Belgian strawberry beer) - fruity and sweet, like liquid strawberry*Floris Apple Ale - fruity and sweet, tasted like a strong apple ciderOverall, food and drinks were good. Only downside would probably be the prices. Sausages ranged from $6-8, and alcoholic drinks started at around $8. Ambiance was different than what you'll find in other places, but this is a good thing in my opinion. The interior designs were pretty cool to look at. Location/parking can potentially be difficult to find, and it's kind of in a sketchy neighborhood."},{"date":"2012-05-31","rating":"4.0","review":"French Fries with truffle oil and garlic...sehr gut! The sausages are super yummy and juicy juicy. I was meaning to eat here since it opened but every time I drove past the restaurant a line was forming down the street, so I avoided this place. Finally, went a few months back and have been twice more since then. They don't have pitchers of beer so get their super-gulp single serving with a couple extra glasses to share with friends. FYI: If you've never been before and you do a drive by and see a crazy line out the door don't get deterred. Those people are probably newbies also. Find a parking spot and go through the back door on the opposite side of the building...it's ok it's not a secret entrance, it's just another way to go into the bar area. Find a seat for you and your pals, get some beer from the bar and send someone to go wait in that awful line out front. If you just go straight to the line, by the time you order, there may be no seating left. GET YOUR SEATS FIRST and drink a whole of beer while you wait.

Maybe I put too much sauerkraut?  Not sure..but it wasn't as good as the others.*Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned with White Wine (3.5 stars): Light in flavor...not as salty as the other brats but still tasty.  Order this if you prefer things lighter in flavor.*Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers (3.5 stars): Flavorful & savory, but not as much as the duck&bacon brat.  Had a slight smokey flavor, which was good too.Mustards (3 types on the table)...i found that if you squeezed too much mustard on the brat, it took away from the taste of it.  So either go without the mustard or go very light on it.Belgian fries...LOVED the fries with the various dips.  Wished the fries were a little less salty though, since the dips already give it so much flavor. Tried the following sauces:  Ranch, chipotle aioli, pesto mayo...favorite was chipotle aioli (addictingly good w/ a slight spice kick).  The pesto mayo was creamy & good too, but the ranch was just ok (skip out on this). Other friends added White truffle oil on the fries, which was delish, but I liked the chipotle aioli better than the truffle oil.  And because the sauces are so flavorful, if you're going to spend the extra money to add truffle oil, then don't' eat the sauces b/c they will overpower the truffle oil taste."},{"date":"2011-12-04","rating":"4.0","review":"I have no way how to pronounce the place so myself and others just call is worst-coochieThe restaurant is in the middle of the art district and you definitely have to be looking for it otherwise you will miss it.

There is a decent beer selection and plenty of dipping sauces for the fries. We ordered the chipotle ailoi and blue cheese walnut bacon sauces, the chipotle sauce was flavorful the blue cheese sauce lacked a lot of flavor and was disappointing. Each table has several types of mustard the spicy brown was the best.

I've been to this place plenty of times, but mostly for bar crawls. The beer selection is pretty good, mostly German and Belgian. Make your way here on Fridays and Saturdays. As a soundtrack to your Wurstküche experience, they have a house DJ (I believe) that mostly plays electronic music and peppers in indie bands like Phoenix. Now with that out of the way. Their sausages are exceptional. My favorite has to be the Filipino Maharlika. I also tried their Louisiana Hot Link, Bratwurst, and Duck & Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers. Given how good those sausages were, I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything off the menu. They also give you a few toppings to choose from to add onto your weenie. Fries are optional. They come with one to two dipping sauces of your choice (depending on the size of your order). Last thing, whole grain mustard. Enough said.P.S.

A basic understanding of German may help with this 1-person debate. In fact, a Google search may resolve this debate, but I'm just too lazy.Other than the name of the restaurant, I have to say that this place is a pretty unique experience in many aspects--obviously the cuisine, the foreign beers, the fun environment, the location, the double confusing entrances, the ordering your own food at the counter in the small room then walking down the hall to the big room to sit down and wait for them to bring the food--just everything is unique. In terms of cuisine, the whole experience reminded me of that great classic movie, \"The Freshman\" starring the incomparable and overly chubbified Marlon Brando and a young, but weird-voiced Matthew Broderick, in which Broderick found out the exotic meats Brando was serving in his restaurant were nothing more than beef and chicken. Don't get me wrong, I loved the food. But, while on paper, the exotic sausages looked amazingly bizarre; in the mouth, the three different kinds of sausages I tried tasted almost exactly alike. Is this a \"Freshman\"-esque trick or something?? I'm pretty sure I'm blowing smoke up everyone's a$$ (otherwise known as a Bangkok Smoke Out), but in all honesty, the only difference between the sausages was each one's level of spicyness. I ended up trying the buffalo, beef & pork with chipotle peppers (I felt bad about this one--I mean buffalo are really majestic creatures, but I get hungry!!); the duck & bacon with jalapeno peppers; and the rabbit, veal & pork seasoned with white wine. All amazingly good, especially with caramelized onions and sweet peppers added on top, but a tad pricey for \"hot dogs\", especially for ones that just taste like normal sausages. Maybe next time I come, I have to try alligator (I might feel bad about this one too) and/or rattlesnake to get different results. Although I did try raw snake when I was little--on a dare--and it did NOT taste very good. I repeat, did NOT taste good.The environment is communal table-style so it's very rowdy, fun, and....communal? Tons of foreign beer to choose from, the best I tasted being the St. Louis Framboise, which tasted like friggin' raspberry juice. Sooooo delicious and girly--just what I like. This may just be the next great birthday dinner destination.Before you go here, I suggest you ponder one thing: What the hell does the umlaut do?? And how the hell does that change the pronunciation of Wurstkuche??

I'm a meat-eater, but not a big time meat-eater, so that may influence my review.  I'll gladly enjoy a quality burger, but I don't think I've once ordered any sort of \"meat lover's\" pizza.  But the menu here sure does pique some interest when it has choices ranging from a simple bratwurst to rattlesnake & rabbit with jalapeno peppers. The ordering process is simple --you choose your meat, choose your two toppings, maybe some sides, and a drink.  The long hallway leads to a dining room in the back, so don't think the handful of stools in the entryway are your only seating areas. I had the Chicken Apple & Spices with caramelized onions and sweet peppers with a side of white truffle oil glazed fries and an Oktoberfest beer.  The main dish: not bad.  I thought the meat had a tough texture to it and it wasn't particularly tasty.  It wasn't bad, it was just...\"oh, that's interesting\".  I'm thinking I should have gone with something else, next time something more basic sounds good. The rest of it, however, was pretty good.The side dish: Oh, those were some good fries.  Spend the extra two bucks to get the fries with the white truffle oil.  Sure the ones without are alright and maybe even healthier, but if you're gonna get fries here, do it right. I had the Chipotle Ketchup dipping sauce, but liked the Sweet and Sassy BBQ sauce more.The beer: Oktoberfest?

Other than that, service is nice, but waiting 20 minutes to get your bratwurst isn't something I look forward to.AMBIANCE: 4 starsI love how it starts as an unassuming narrow hallway and then opens up into a hip, modern picnic bench area with ample seating here and there. The outside area is chilly due to the draft from being in a narrow street, but it's a nice area to eat on a warm, sunny day."},{"date":"2013-10-23","rating":"3.0","review":"Great food, but the ambiance is ruined by the super loud music played by an idiot \"DJ\", and by the douchebag hipsters you're crowded by."},{"date":"2011-08-29","rating":"5.0","review":"One of the best places to go with a some friends or even a date for a delicious meal and great beer. I have to laugh when people complain about the noise. It's a German beer hall environment! What exactly were you expecting? Admittedly, I have a hearing problem when there is a lot of background noise, but I still always have a good time.Delicious sausages, great selection on beer and sitting at the communal long tables is a lot of fun. The rattlesnake sausage isn't actually worth it. Go with something else.Here's the thing about the line: If the line moved any faster, there wouldn't be enough room for everyone to eat and you'd be waiting with food getting cold. The inconvenience of having to wait so long before you sit down actually works to flow of people. Just prepare for a 25 minute wait from the time you stand in line to the time you get your food at a table. If you think about it that way, it's still faster than sitting down at a typical restaurant."},{"date":"2013-08-18","rating":"4.0","review":"The food is good, but the odd hot dogs really don't have that much of a different taste.

Even when I came here super full from another restaurant 2 hours prior, the food was still AAAMAZING! My friend ordered the 2 exotics: duck and bacon with jalapeño peppers & the rattlesnake and rabbit with jalapeño peppers and both have caramelized onions! Both were juicy and very tasty! The rattlesnake and the rabbit sausage was mild in flavor but pretty tasty and the duck bacon had a bolder flavor that was also tasty. Not fatty at all as one might think with duck and bacon. We also ordered with truffle fries with the pesto mayo sauce and the blue cheese walnut and bacon! My favorite sauce was the pesto mayo!! It was creamy and pesto was not overpowering at all. The blue cheese walnut and bacon was good too. Blue cheese did not really stand out for me. Both were creamy sauces. Let me just say.... It seems like their truffle fries was powdered with cocaine bec I was addicted!! Regardless of how full I was! I couldn't stop eating like a major PORKER! I loved their unique choices of bottled soda, they have box water, and even cucumber soda? Wth? Pretty cool but I helped myself with their complimentary Cucumber water. So refreshing!!  It was cool seeing people being served beer or whatever they wanted to drink while waiting in line to order.  The dining area had a modern chic cafeteria style seating that would be perfect for large groups! I wish they had a DJ when we went but it was still early.  This is a spot where I would definitely love to go to all the time to eat, drink and be merry with my friends in San Diego, if they would open one there. Till then, I guess I will have to get myself to drive hours and hours to come back and enjoy this lovely place. :(I wanted to add... This is definitely way better quality than Pinks hot dogs! Don't listen to those people that says pinks is better. Haha totally different caliber of sausage and hot dogs! This is like creme brûlée and pinks is like jello caliber hahaha jk.

The sausage was packed with flavors. I have never had rabbit before. After eating this sausage, I really want to have rabbit. And, I love the casing. The crunchy texture made the sausage perfect. The bun was interesting. It was a bit like biscuit. Because of the crunchy casing, it was hard to eat with hands. I ended up using fork and knife. The BELGIAN FRIES were delicious!

My edibles-review mirrors my review of Wurstküche Venice:The Truffle Fries are delicious and well worth the caloric intake. Wurstküche has delicious veggie sausages, usually three variety, for peskies like me: Vegetarian Italian, Smoked Apple Sage, or Mexican Chipotle. The caramelized onions, sauerkraut, hot peppers and sweet peppers are delicious (and my preference is in that order), but if you cannot decide your choice of toppings, you can request a side of each to play a, mix-n-match, combine-flavors game. I also lineup the mustards and ketchup at my arms' reach, to keep the taste fest going.The beer selection is sure to keep any beer aficionado most pleased.There really is something to be said for functional architecture. The architecture of both Wurstküches deserves a mention, as it affects the dining experience so strongly. The exposed wood and cement feel is just utilitarian enough; just modern enough that you dont feel like its too fancy to ride up with your motorcycle/skateboarding/bicycle crew and really bring the party, all in your leather or casual clothes, bandannas, helmets, silly sunglasses, hole-ridden Vans, etc. It is also nice enough that if you came in all gussied up in your best Labyrinth costume, Icelandic-choir-singer-with-Bjork dress, designer with Skingraft, aerialst with Lucent Dossier, or FiDM graduation fancies, it shouldn't disturb the gastronomical experience of your fellow diners in the least -- and, for the record, it hasn't. The outside tables area, worthy of note, is a fave with the locals who walk there with their four-footed furry friends.If you are meeting a large party of friends, this setup is ideal; you score a place at a long table with your friends no matter your meal cost.

Building exterior has a revamped warehouse feel + the patio seating. You walk in and place your order then head to the back and seat yourself (communal seating - rows of bench seating plus several booths lined along the walls). Atmosphere was great. Gets a bit loud. Very friendly service. All sausages come with the option of two toppings (choice between spicy peppers, sweet peppers, caramelized onions or sauerkraut). We tried the duck & bacon, alligator & pork and rattlesnake & rabbit sausages. Also ordered large fries (thick cut) which came with two dipping sauces and cherry ginger ale. Everything was delicious and unique in its own right. My personal favorite was the alligator and pork - burst of juicy pork/andouille flavor with a dash of spiciness. Rattlesnake/rabbit was full of flavor as well but too light for my tasting. Belgian fries were delicious and the chipotle aioli dipping sauce complimented them nicely. General condiments are in huge bottles placed at \"center\" of every table. So glad I came. Great food. Would love to come back to try their other sausages!Parking is a bit scarce (typical street parking in DTLA). I could see how parking could be an issue during their busier hours."},{"date":"2011-09-08","rating":"5.0","review":"A selection of strange and exoctic sausages?  Extensive belgian and german draft beer selection? Four different tpyes of mustard at your table?  What else would four guys out on a man-date away from the wives and kids for the night want?  Sure, if you show up after 7:00 on a Friday night, you're going to have to wait in line for 20-30 minutes, but hell, that just gives you time to BS with your buddies, catch up, and to craft your meal from their menu.Plus, the place has something for everybody...rattlesnake and rabbit sausage for the right wing gun owners, and a vegan sausages for a discount for the card carrying KCRW Santa Monica lefties."},{"date":"2009-08-04","rating":"4.0","review":"Don't be scared of hundreds of sausages in your face when you walk up to the cold case. There are too many varieties of tubed meat to talk about but i eventually ended up going for the dunk, bacon, and i think jalapeno with sauerkraut, grilled onions and mustard. It sure was full of flavor, but right then and there i realized that i guess i don't like my buns filled with so much flavor and actually prefer a plainer sausage. It would actually probably taste really good with some rice, but just not my taste.There was a good 15 minute or so wait to get to the counter to make our order, but a dude got us our drink orders so at least we could have a drink as we waited and waited and waited (amazing how long 15 minutes can feel like when you're hungry and just trying to order).The dining area is like a picnic inside, and finding seats you're just going to have to ask ... is anyone sitting here ... like 4 times before you get a spot. Thankfully there's another bar on the inside so you're not going to have to wait for another drink to save your mouth from some of the burning flavors of sausages in your mouth. Really cool place as long as you can find a place to sit.

On Saturdays they have a DJ there. Wait: The lines can get pretty long. I went on a weeknight and it wasn't crowded at all. The last time I went was on a Saturday and the line was out the door. We waited at least 15-20 min. The best part is that they take your drink order when you get closer to the door and so you can drink while you wait to order. You then walk through this long hallway all the way to the back which opens up to this warehouse setting w/ long tables and a bar in the back. There's also outdoor seating.

The actual setting of the venue was great, I loved the atmosphere and the choice of ambiance. All of the food we ordered was excellent, my friends and I were sitting in a corner of the seating area eating . . .  I was pretty inconspicuously desalting some of my fries (we shared one order of fries), I for one enjoy less than the usual amount of salt on my fries. One of the people who worked there noticed this without any prompting from myself, and came over and gave me a free order of fries with less salt free of charge. It was really quite impressive, that anyone was paying that much attention to anything on that minute a level.

However, I still had been wanting to try this place because I have heard so much about it.At 8pm on Sunday night, it was pretty crowded.  Four of us had to wait in line for bit before ordering our meals.  I had the chicken and apple sausage with onions and sweet peppers.  I was glad they offered more \"tame\" options, as opposed to alligator and rabbit...I was even surprised that they had three vegetarian options!I'm not a big beer person either, but I thought it was appropriate to order one.  Since my sausage had apple and cinnamon in it, I chose an apple ale that was sweet, but to my liking.  I really enjoyed the bread, not your typical store bought hot dog bun, and the fries were especially delicious!  I have tried variations of Belgian fries, and I have to say these were my favorite.  Nice and crisp on the outside with the right amount of salt and seasoning.  Yum!!The seating arrangement is different than most places.  After you order your food at the counter, you can pick your seat.  There are a number of smaller tables around the perimeter of the space, and the middle portion has several large communal tables.  I actually like the the atmosphere the communal tables creates.  Nice design move.  To make the place even better, they play some good beats.  If I am ever in the area again, I would definitely eat here, mainly to experience the laid back atmosphere and nosh on their delicious fries!"},{"date":"2013-11-03","rating":"5.0","review":"Love this place, great atmosphere, food, and beer.

It was also a tad dry or something. The rattlesnake with rabbit just tasted like a normal sausage, which I guess is both good and bad.  Good because \"normal\" sausage tastes good!  Bad because I expect something special if I'm going to eat something weird.  But I suppose if special means tasting like the sea, then normal is awesome.  Having a HUGE fear of snakes, I'm glad I got to eat one.  Feels oddly satisfying. :oDNote: if you want real caramelized onions, this isn't the place to get it. If you see my photo somewhere on here, you'll notice the onions still look a tad raw. I avoided eating them. I was also expecting the \"sweet peppers\" to be like the ones I used to get on my chicken cheesesteaks in Philly...the slightly pickled ones. But these were just normal bell peppers. Boo.As for the ambience and beverages, I love the wooden benches and weird drawings from other gastropubbers on the pieces of paper covering the tables.  And I love the selection of beers.  The one strange thing is that, despite the beam of sun that comes through the windows on a nice day (you best wear sunglasses if you're facing that direction), there is still something a bit cold about the atmosphere.  Something's missing that makes it lack a bit of character.I'd still go there for more sausage and beer though!  Imagine what other crazy animals I'd eat on a good appetite!"},{"date":"2013-03-30","rating":"5.0","review":"This is the spot if you're looking for Crocodile/Pork hot dogs!!!

A purveyor of exotic sausages? I'm from GA, I have no idea what that even means. So I walk inside, and there's a glass case with sausages and a menu overhead, and I couldn't match the names to the sausage if you asked me too. Then I saw the extensive beer menu, so I ordered that first. I always felt like with a beer, the mind is clear. Next I ordered fries, the large size or a groot, with a few dipping sauces for variety so I could evaluate which I liked. Ok, back to the final part, the main reason for being here, sausages. So you pick a sausage, they have 6 classics, 8 gourmet, and 7 exotics. What exactly is exotic? How about buffalo, beef, and pork? Or duck, bacon, w jalapenos? Perhaps crocodile, pork, andouille? Even rattlesnake, rabbit, jalapenos. I went with a simple gourmet chicken apple and spices. A great choice. You get two toppings, either caramelized onions, sauerkraut, spicy or sweet peppers. Then there are several types of mustard you can add yourself. All in all, I admit, I had a great experience. I ended up getting in line and ordering again before I left. Not that I was hungry.

To be sure, the ingredients are definitely promising. Duck and bacon. Rattlesnake and rabbit. Weird and weirder combined in one sausage casing in hopes of making something magical. The intent is there but the execution is definitely lacking.The rattlesnake and rabbit tasted like, you guessed it, chicken sausage. The duck and bacon with jalapeño tasted like a jalapeño Italian sausage. Both were just okay and the latter was significantly overcooked which, as a sausage cooking connoisseur, I know is difficult. Low and steady heat, not high and flaring flames.The selection of beers is immense and definitely a plus but until they get the sausage making and cooking down it will be relegated to 3-stars in my book.

It was the best hot dog I have ever had. My friend had the rabbit veal hot dog. Juicy and perfect in size. Not too pricey. They also have a whole grain option for the mustard flavor. It gets super interesting crowd observing in there. It's like a hipster high school cafeteria, with really good sausages, mixed with fancy beer, with music that makes you want to dance, with security guards walking around and bouncers outside a hot dog stand? So you forget if you are at a cafeteria, mall, restaurant, bar or a club."},{"date":"2012-03-20","rating":"5.0","review":"DUCK & BACON. DO YOU REALLY NEED ANYTHING ELSE?Lets start out with the service.  A server will greet you and ask you if you would like a beer while you wait for your order/table. Any place that'll do that is OK with me.They've got a lot of great beers on tap as well as bottled (I went with tremens this time because..well...tremens is tasty as allll hell). Once we got to ordering, I got the Sun Dried Tomatoes/Mozzarella Chicken sausage, as well as duck/bacon (duh), while my friends ordered the rattlesnake/rabbit.We also got a mountain of the Belgian fries, because they are downright TASTY, and if you don't like them, your opinion is wrong.It was a cold ass day in LA, so inside was a bit crowded, but whatevers, we got a spot. Don't be afraid to get cozy either, because chances are you might sit next to a stranger (benches and shared tables). Its a cool affair, and as long as you are good people you'll get along fine here. They've got a bar that you can sit at as well, as well as outdoor seating, but like I said, it was a cold night.Now. The Food.AWWWW YEAH.The fries are bomb, and have this crazy dope seasoning.  We got 4 dipping sauces, and while they were all good, I recommend the greek yogurt, and the pesto, as they compliment the fries the best out of all their sauces.They take their hot dogs very seriously here. The bread is fluffy and soft. Think of how soft your girl's ass is on a good night, and you'll see where i'm getting at.The mozzarella/sun dried tomatoes was an explosion of all those flavors in every bite.  Nothing really overpowered the other, and the kraut and onions I ordered along with it complemented the juicy sausage well.The duck and bacon is a hearty, hearty piece of meat. I wish I had ordered it on its on. Its was a little less juicy than the other sausage I had, as the duck meat and bacon seemed to have absorbed all the juices to create a thick piece of sausage. The peppers and onions that hugged the sausage set off the sausage like fireworks. Again, not overpowering, nothing was too salty or too savory, and the dog was just right.They've got dope music spinning all day long, and its a good place to start the night, or in my case, an end to a great mini-vacation.Be back soon :D"},{"date":"2009-05-31","rating":"4.0","review":"I visited Wurstkuche (\"Sausage Kitchen\" in German) late one Friday night. Even though we had already eaten, all of their sausages looked so good we didn't know what to choose so we ended up ordering 5 different kinds to try. Between 2 people who had just finished dinner, this was a lot of food and we anticipated leftovers, but all of them were so good we ended up finishing everything....even though it meant stuffing ourselves to the max. The most flavorful one was the Mango Jalapeno Chicken.  It didn't taste much like mango, but it was spicy and delicious. The Cilantro & Chili (Chicken & Turkey) was also really good, but not as good as the Chicken, Apples & Spices. I didn't like the Louisiana Hot Link too much, but it was still decent. The Roasted Red Peppers, Corn & Chicken sounded interesting, but I was told they're no longer serving that one.You can choose 2 toppings from the following:  caramelized onions, sauerkraut, spicy peppers, and sweet peppers. (I thought the caramelized onions and sauerkraut were the best).There are bottles of different types of mustards scattered throughout the restaurant (self-serve), including: Whole Grain, Dijon, Spicy Brown, Honey Mustard, and American Yellow.If you visit at night, it gets pretty loud because a DJ is on duty. During the day, there's a more laid back feel - with lots of natural light from the big windows.Cons: There are only a couple of choices under $7 (most of them are the vegetarian options). Everything else is $7-$8. For hot dogs, I can see why lots of people complain about the price. They definitely aren't your run-of the mill hot dogs, but they aren't very big either. Another thing that people seemed a little dissatisfied about was the long wait for their food after ordering. Again, if we weren't talking about hot dogs, I think most people would be okay waiting 20-25 minutes.All in all, Wurstkuche is a unique concept and a great addition to the L.A. food scene. Parking can be tricky because it's adjacent to Zip Fusion, Blue Dahlia and a couple of other restaurants."},{"date":"2012-03-28","rating":"5.0","review":"Wurstkuche, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways...1. Even if your line is long, if I order a beer, I can drink it while I wait.2. Your duck, bacon, and jalapeño exotic dog with sweet peppers and onions was one of the best things I've eaten in a long time.3. Your Belgian frites are so delicious, my group had to order them twice.4. The cafeteria style seating may be loud, but it's a refreshing break from stuffy restaurants. 5. So many condiments to choose from, every visit you can eat the same thing in a different way.I love how hidden this place is, and yet it's always so busy. Normally I'm not a fan of loud and crowded places, but wurstkuche is so good, it's easy to forget the hustle and bustle."},{"date":"2011-06-27","rating":"5.0","review":"I came here during the week because one of our friends has been raving about it. We were NOT disappointed!!! Free parking was hard to find, but metered parking is available next to the joint. Although its located right on the corner it's kind of hard to spot because there is no sign.Once you get in you notice the small establishment BUT WAIT if you go to the right of the register down the hallway there is a bunch of seating and there is some nice outdoor seating available too! The line could get pretty long so be wary of that. While in line though, you can help yourself to some cucumber water on the side of the restaurant -- so great... and you can even see the sausages in the fridge right next to the register!I had shared two dogs and fries with my friend. We ordered the duck, bacon and jalapeno peppers sausage. SO OUT OF THIS WORLD. I don't even know where to begin... let's just say I wish the sausage would never end. I also had the Filipino Marharlika and I totally thought it would be like langonisa but it wasn't... it was a sort of sweet pork sausage, while great I don't think it was worth $6.50. I was also able to get a bite of the Mango Jalapeno which had to be my favorite overall.... sweet and tender... it was one of those instances where you tried to bite as small as you could so you could make the moment last forever... but it didn't.Did I mention we ordered the fries glazed with white truffle oil? You can definitely tell the difference between the fries with and without the oil. With the fries we ordered the curry ketchup and aioli. Curry Ketchup = greatest invention ever because not only do I love the spices of curry but the sweetness of ketchup... it was almost too much to handle.Definitely recommend this place to all you Yelpers out there! You won't be let down! Service was notably remarkable too!

First time, I had the Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle which I thought was absolutely horrible. Just not appetizing in the least. I think it was mostly because it was vegetarian and had no real meat in it. Second time, I had the Santa Fe Jack Cheese & Jalapeno Peppers. This dog was really good and full of flavor. To be honest though, the fries are what I like the best about this place. The dipping sauces are terrific. I've had the Pesto, Chipotle Ketchup, Chipotle Aioli, and Tzatziki and all are excellent choices. Wurstkuche is one of those super trendy/hipster places to hang out late night which is meh to me. I feel like it's more of being there just to be there rather than being there because of the particular food they serve. Going for the name/hype.

This fact or fiction certainly added joy to my overall feeling about the meal.  Parking is hard to find, we parked at the parking lot for $3.  The serving is like the cafeteria style, you order and pay at the register, you get a number, find a seat and they will bring the food to you.

The dogs with fruit like mango and apple make for a sweeter taste and a good compliment if you are sharing a few with friends.You can have 2 toppings on the dogs, but I dont think that is necessary - sometimes one or none is enough if you are having mustard or ketchup.Fries are great as with the great selection of Belgium, German and American beers.

Overall....I was satisfied.  The sausages were distinct and unique.....and they went perfectly with their bun and condiments.  A hot dog here runs you about $8 and the wait is about 30-40 minutes on a weeknight....so it isn't something you'd eat every day.  That being considered....I recommend that if you come here, don't go for the safe choice.  If you want safe...go to Costco.  Challenge yourself and try the most unique sausage you can find."},{"date":"2009-07-28","rating":"4.0","review":"You have redeemed yourself, Wurstkuche!

Here's why:The sausage is not the main idea.Because this gastropub is known for its unique and exciting sausages, I was really excited to taste their signature sausages. I ordered the Austin Blues because I was in the mood for a spicy dog. The Austin Blues was not spicy at all (despite its description as being \"hot and spicy\" with \"tri-pepper\", but even I can forgive that. The thing most disappointing was how dim the spotlight on the flavors of my dog was.I expected bold and exciting, but instead I got underwhelming and barely there tastes. I almost wish I had gotten no onions or sauerkraut so the flavor would be more bold - but a dog without onions or sauerkraut is just preposterous!I think that this place is mainly popular because of its hip atmosphere and wide selection of beers. It definitely carries that cool, downtown pub feel with its industrial, yet earthy decor. And the Chimay was delectable (it always is!).

Although, it found it odd eating rattlesnake in sausage form, since its naturally tubular.  The duck was decent, smokey and palatable as well.  The fries were top notch,  especially good with the unique pesto dipping sauce, one of a variety of dipping choices.  With a pretty cool staff, I would have loved to stay and try all the beers and sausages, and bottom out on fries ... but alas, one must watch the figure in old age.  Perhaps next time!"},{"date":"2013-10-16","rating":"4.0","review":"Really like the chill lounge area and nice vibe"},{"date":"2013-09-17","rating":"5.0","review":"In-cased meats in tube form and beer, doesn't get any better."},{"date":"2014-07-03","rating":"5.0","review":"I can't stay away from this place.

Upon receiving a recommendation from a friend, I just had to try this place out.Trying to find the exact location of this place was an adventure in itself. My friends and I came at night, so we were trying to locate this cleverly hidden place while wandering aimlessly around what seemed to be a shady part of dtown LA. After missing a turn here, making a random turn there, going up and down a street, then retracing our steps for a bit, we finally reached our destination. Lucky for us, there were a few open parking spaces in front of what appeared to be an apartment complex of art studios or the type.The line, even around dinner time, was pretty fast. No jk. Once we got in and ordered, the next phase of dinner was a bit more troublesome, seeing as how there weren't really any seats in the back area. But my friends and I did manage to snatch a few, so we plopped down and waited for our food.Then it arrived. My large beautiful heavenly bratwurst dog topped with sauerkraut and caramelized onions. I took one bite into it and my mouth just exploded with a swirling immersion of flavor that almost brought me back to that Dresdener Bratwurst I had. But with respect to being a continent and ocean away from Germany, this definitely hit the spot.As for the fries, they come in Klein (small) or Groot (large). Nothing too special, in my opinion. Or maybe I just had a bad batch, for other reviews seem to rank the fries a pedestal higher or etwas.Unfortunately for my friends and I, we weren't quite of age for the alcoholic drinks. I assume the night would've been that much more exciting if we had been able to sample one of the many drinks offered.But $6 for the Bratwurst dog?? Can't beat it. I'll be sure to come back for my Bratwurst craving, not to mention I must try out their exotic dogs as well. (Rabbit? Alligator? Amazing!)Can't go wrong with Wurstküche."},{"date":"2013-04-24","rating":"4.0","review":"was hard to find but worth the search. The fries are AMAZING. The beer selection is great.

Needless to say, he LOVES Wurst.The food is great; I believe I had the Duck and Bacon last time, which was very tasty. Whenever I've been, they've had someone near the door to make sure the people in line have something to drink while they wait. He generally chats with everyone and distracts you from the fact that you're waiting, though I don't think I've ever had to wait incredibly long.It's a simple enough idea and my only problem is the layout. It's pretty small with a weird shape. The restaurant is very narrow, with the kitchen and order station in the middle. You come in one door and order, then you have the choice of sitting/eating in the front next to the line (which curls awkwardly against the V-shaped walls) or going past the kitchen to the back, where there are two or three community-style tables and a scattering of more intimate tables. And a bar. There is a patio area as well, which I haven't used. The few times I have been there, the community-style tables were packed or reserved, though it turns out the \"reserved\" signs are there early, just as a warning (they have the reservation time written on them). You can sit there, you just need to scram before the party arrives. I managed to find a little coffin-shaped table next to the turntables or whatever and I was pretty comfortable.I get pretty anxious in crowded places, but I felt okay here once I found a seat. I think a more well-adjusted person would be absolutely fine. The important thing to know is that it does get crowded and you should try to get there early if possible. Try one of their more exotic sausages, get the curry ketchup, and don't forget to order your fries with truffle oil (like I did, twice)."},{"date":"2013-06-13","rating":"4.0","review":"Yum, yum.

The front room to place your order is a but small, so don't feel uncomfortable if someone is standing a little too close to you. The staff is very welcoming and are quick to suggest their favorite items on the menu if your uncertain about what to order.I highly recommend the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage! Topped with sauerkraut and grilled onion made it absolutely perfect. It's one of my favorite sausages here, but I also like the mango/jalapeno as well with spicy peppers. The fries are great and the large is perfect for sharing. Personal favorites for dipping sauces are the chipotle and blue cheese/walnut (which the large fries comes with two sauces).Can we talk about the beer selection? They offer over 40 different brews and I always go back to the Floris Apple Ale, but I really enjoyed the IPA the last time I went.Once you've ordered, the seating area is at the end of long hallway and they have long tables with benches and several smaller tables along the far wall. Seating outside is also great if you want a view of the Art District, or have your dog with you. They also have a bar by the tables so getting another beer is a breeze.I would highly recommend this restaurant/bar to anyone wanting to try a new downtown restaurant. The atmosphere is low-key (at least during the day) and the food is always great. Only reason I give it a 4-star rating is because street parking can be somewhat difficult, but when is it ever easy parking in downtown?"},{"date":"2013-11-06","rating":"5.0","review":"Delicious.

She told me where this place was but even when you're there you are not exactly sure if you are there. But the brave souls that we are, we opened the door and the first thing we see a line of taps. Yes, we're in the right spot okay! The long benches immediately made me think of Oktoberfest but it was the tables to the left with the wire mesh chairs that caught my eye. Probably because they were located near the windows (natural light) and that there were only 4 of us.A waiter, so we thought, came up to us and told us how to order. Nope, he wasn't there to take any orders. He told us we needed to go behind the dark grey wall, walk all the way to the end, and order there. We finally came to the end of the dark hallway to find a small, hot kitchen area with a display of many different types of sausages. I had no clue what to get- normally you just order a brat, right? Well, there are choices galore and since I was here I just had to try to rattlesnake and rabbit although I normally probably wouldn't. The sausage was fantastic. Lots of flavor, perfect amount of spice, loved it! I also like the fact there are various types of mustards to choose from. We also got fries and opted for the curry ketchup, which was about the best I've had. I felt the beers were a bit overpriced and I loved how the Franziskaner happened to be empty so they pushed me to the Edel Weiss which was double the price ($11). I opted to just go with a Pisner. I noticed the DJ stand as we were walking towards the dark hallway so I assume they have music either at night or on the weekends. It was pretty packed for happy hour but the music was non-existent, at least until we left at 7PM."},{"date":"2013-09-15","rating":"3.0","review":"I've been for lunch a few times, and it has never disappointed.  I stick with the classics, like the brat and Italian sausage.  Portions are a bit small, so you may want to order two per person.  Metered parking is usually available during the day, but I would go just before noon to beat the weekday lunch rush."},{"date":"2013-08-12","rating":"5.0","review":"Great food.

I would love to go back again just to be able to try more of their selection of sausages.I got their duck & bacon hot dog with caramelized onions and spicy peppers and fries with sun dried tomato mayo dip. The hot dog was juicy and the bun was fluffy. It was pretty dang perfect with the onions, although I gotta say the spicy peppers were a bit weird since I didn't expect them to be raw. I was for some reason hoping they'd be roasted or grilled peppers? Either way, the hot dog was great!Fries were the bomb, no lie. Usually fries cut this thick get soggy pretty easily, but nope! Not these! The tomato mayo dip was amazing too. I'm already planning to try the chipotle aioli next time.The whole place was very interesting. A bit loud, but sometimes all the noise and blaring music can come in handy if you're maybe on an awkward date. At least there's a lot of noise going on to fill the silence. Or if you're an old married couple with nothing left to talk about. So dark, you can't even see each other. The dark bar/club concept could work somehow in those situations.

Appropriately located in the Arts District of the city, this restaurant is clean and has simple but hip decor. Now on to the food!There is a huge variety of sausages you can pick, ranging from \"classics\" ($5.50, bratwurst, italian, vegetarian options) to \"gourmet\" ($6.50, Louisiana hot links, kielbasa, chicken apple), and finally the \"exotics\" ($7.50, sausages that have alligator, buffalo, rabbit, duck, or rattlesnake meat depending on what you get). So everything's fairly priced. There a nice little selection of classic sodas and an even bigger selection of beers on tap. There were so many choices, everyone in my party definitely took some time to decide what to order. Ultimately, we all go either the smoke andouille sausage with alligator and pork meat or the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage with jalapeno peppers. It just sounded so....interesting. Gotta at least give it a try! Each sausage was served on its own roll with your choice of two from four toppings: sauerkraut, carmelized onions, sweet peppers, spicy peppers. There's also four different kinds of mustard you can put on your sausage by yourself if you wish.  The sausages were delicious, very juicy but it didn't feel like it was just seeping in oil. As for the exotic meats we picked...well, it's all in a sausage casing so there's not a huge distinction besides the color. Nevertheless, it was interesting. The toppings nicely complimented the entire meal and never overpowered the taste of the sausage.We also ordered two large orders of Belgian fries, also very good. The insides were nice and soft and the outside had a slighty crunchy texture. But the best part of getting the fries was the variety of dipping sauces they had. Because we ordered two larges, we had a choice of four sauces out of ten. We choose thai peanut, curry ketchup, tzatziki, and blue cheese walnut & bacon. All four were great, but my personal favorite was the thai peanut sauce.   Finally for dessert, we ordered the toasted apple pie ice cream sandwich. The cookies were oatmeal raisin and while I also extremely enjoyed this, I couldn't taste the apple pie part of it. Still good though.I'm definitely coming back to try more of Wurstkuche's sausages!"},{"date":"2011-09-19","rating":"4.0","review":"Been eyeing this place since my last few trips to L.A. since my neighbor I grew up with mentioned it.. Didn't quite make it the first time.. I guess this place has got the word around cause another one of my friends (since highschool) mentioned it too! This next visit to L.A., In between errands we made it to Downtown, more specific the secluded Arts District..Sausages Galore, but we went with a Staff Members prime choice:Mango Jalapeno (under gourmet subtitle): comes on a freshly baked roll and 2 toppings. We went with the suggested: caramelized onions and sweet peppers (didn't go with the spicy since it already had jalapeno). It was about as long as a regular sized hotdog and as thick as the 7-11 large/jumbo hotdog.. Beautiflly balnced sweetness and spice! Great juicy flavor! On the small side for the price.. They got several different mustard compliments at your disposal (tableside), deli, dijon.... Belgian Fries and Bleu Cheese Walnut and Bacon Dip: got the small (\"klein\") good enough for one hungry person. They are \"double dipped\", my friend told me they fry it twice.. I couldn't tell a difference until I bit into one. It did have a different crunch to it but maybe I was just thinking about it too much?.. Well, they were good fries nonetheless. It came with 1 dip of your choice and we went with the Yelp quick tips and highlights for this one. It may had been and obvious choice anyway but it sure does live up to the reviews! Just a hint of that pungent bleu cheese, a tad earthy walnutiness plus some smokey bacon.. If that doesn't do it for you, I'm throwing in the towel! * We both had the Peach Soda, complimented the meal beautifully.. Lots of drinks to choose from.Urban Modern Restaurant with Sausages ranging from the classic brat to exotic rattlesnake..

Very lean and slightly chewy, but I thought it was tasty, despite what my coworkers thought it might be EWWWW. The belgian fries were also pretty good, nice touch of sea salt to enhance the flavor, and the way it was cooked seemed a little different then just a deep fry.Although I couldn't drink they had a good selection of different beers from Belgium and Germany so I'd have to give them the star back they lost from them making me wait a hella long time for my food. For the nonalcoholic drinkers they have a good selection of specialty bottled drinks which I tried the Curisoity Cola, which wasn't too fizzy like Coca-Cola, but had a great taste.Besides waiting forever and a day, (I still can't get over that wait time, just look at the photo I uploaded, there were still at least 8 people behind me) the food taste and quality is great.

Soda was good, just expensive for my tastes. $5 dollars a bottle of some organic stuff. Friend told me they had free water that has a cucumber flavor. My friends got a rattlesnake and rabbit with sauerkraut and the other got the alligator and pork I think with onions and sweet peppers. They said it was okay. The hot peppers were not hot at all or even had any flavor. It was just there. Onions I tasted. Sausage was good and not dry. Bun was also fresh. It seems that any of the sausages you get you need to put something else on it, be it ketchup or one of their mustards. If you eat it straight up then it won't be that great. I guess I just expected more from a $7.50 hot dog. The fries were good. Can't really say it is worth $4 for a small order and $1.50 extra for the truffle oil. I will most likely go here again to give it another shot. Hopefully on a weekend or Friday so I can drink. I got to say, it is worth it to go at least once to say you tried it.

The first time I visited was over a year ago, and I still remember how delicious my encased meat was that very day. I had the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers sausage with sauerkraut and spicy brown mustard. The bun was perfectly toasted and the meat was just as described on their menu: \"buttery but mildly spicy.\"And the Belgian Fries? Perfectly fried and sprinkled with delicious salt. You can't go wrong with the Chipotle Ketchup or the Sundried Tomato Mayo. I prefer the latter.My next trip was a few weeks ago when a good friend of mine (and also a lover of encased meats) made the trip to Los Angeles from Chicago. I knew Wurstküche would hit the spot, so we ventured downtown on the subway and walked from Pershing Square (in order to work up an appetite).This time I opted for another of their exotic sausages: Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers. Same toppings as before as well: sauerkraut and spicy brown mustard. And again, I was not disappointed. Delicious sausage with that perfect \"snap\" with every bite. Oh, casings. Yum.We split a \"Groot\" order of fries and enjoyed the beautiful weather while dining outside.One thing I wish we had taken advantage of was their extensive beer menu. Both visits I was here for lunch, and although my last name starts with an \"O\" and an apostrophe, my liver (and other organs) never seem too fond of the libations. But when I do drink beer (no, not Dos Equis), I prefer delicious, light German pilsner. Next time, I promise I'll eat my encased meats in honor of Germany with a large helping of beer. Hopefully the budget has room for it ... as you can see from their menu, they are a bit pricey. But fair.I did, though, partake in a Manhattan Special Sarsaparilla, and it hit the spot. Even though it is an odd pairing with Duck and Bacon. My buddy had the delicious and light Mr. Q Cumber Soda and after having it, he vowed to make his own recipe at home in Chicago.All in all, Wurstküche is a great dining experience. The beer garden feel of the back room made me feel like just for a moment I was back in Berlin.If you love encased meats, this is one of the great places in L.A. to go."},{"date":"2013-05-11","rating":"5.0","review":"This place ist die beste! Haha. Though the line goes out of the building, it doesn't take too long to order. The girl behind the counter was very nice. I got the mango jalapeno with spicy and sweet peppers, the large fries with Thai peanut (meh) and chipotle aioli (complete opposite of meh! YUM!), and Fentimans ginger beer. You will not believe how excited I was to see that they had ginger beer, and Fentimans at that.  The wait for food wasn't too bad, either, and everything tasted delicious and fresh. You live up to your reputation, Wurstkuche!"},{"date":"2011-04-24","rating":"4.0","review":"Damn that rattlesnake is delicious!  (Yeah yeah yeah I know, \"That's what she said\") but all seriousness aside, it was f*cking tasty and flavorful.  4 stars for the food and minus one for the lack of friendliness or helpfulness for first time customers. My bf Chucky and I have been wanting to try this place for so long so we decided to have me a little birthday lunch here before our big dinner with my fam later that night.It was a bit tough to find parking, we had to circle around twice and finally found one a few blocks away.  They're in an industrial area so if you're coming in groups here, try and carpool to save time and frustration.I've heard there's been lines that wrap around the building just to order at this place so luckily we came on a Monday early afternoon so there was no line.  But it being our first time eating here (I've drank here before so only been to the bar side of this spot), we did not know you have to grab a menu from in front of the cashier.  We just looked at the glass window selection of sausages and thought you picked out that way since there was no visible menu up on top or anywhere for that matter?  We ordered two rattle snake/ rabbit sausage dogs infused with jalepeno peppers, shared an alligator and pork sausage dog, and also shared a Filipino Maharlika, which is sweet pork and similar in flavor to the Filipino Tocino.  The rattle snake seemed to be both our favorites, seeing that we pretty much inhaled them.  I also loved the Maharlika and would get it again and again but didn't care too much for the alligator.  It was a bit on the sour side and just a taste I can't describe.  Definitely can't compare it to any other meat, I just know it wasn't one I'll order again.  Didn't even finish it, had to give the rest to my bf.  Each hot dog gets two toppings, which our tattooed, mono-toned, suicidal looking, can't crack a smile if her life depended on it, cashier rudely let us know by pretty much shoving those paper menus (which I thought were just to take for to go or something)  in our faces and asking us to choose one of the toppings from the top.  I just wonder how this works out for the first timers who come waiting in those long lines and pretty much not knowing how to order until you're in front of the cashier while she stares at you.  We had no line behind us yet she completely made us feel rushed especially as she was staring at us frustrated while we checked out the toppings.  What more if they were backed up?  She interrupted us after every hot dog we ordered to ask which toppings we wanted.  Umm can you wait until we're done ordering or is that too much information for you to take in at once?  I got grilled sweet peppers and grilled onions for my toppings and Chucky got all sauerkraut as his.  We also ordered fries with a chipotle aoli for our dipping sauce.  The fries were not too salty, and just the right amount of crispiness and biting into it tasted amazing especially with that aoli.   I'm hoping I caught that cashier on a bad day because Chucky and I definitely plan on going back and trying the other sausages they have to offer.  I will grab another rattlesnake, it's my new favorite!  Goes well with the Chimay we both got.  I also loved their wide range of beers on tap and can't wait to see what other ones I can get my hands on.  Cheers!"},{"date":"2013-05-11","rating":"4.0","review":"you wont feel super healthy but its good.  i like the mustards.  the variety of sausages is almost overwhelming.   but good.  I would prefer a different type of bun than the fancy chewy bun.   But the sausages and beer is good.its super loud though.  and dark.  i guess they wanted something like a hip,  club environment.  but its more like eating dinner at a strip club.  youll never spot the hair in your food."},{"date":"2010-01-21","rating":"4.0","review":"Sausages, buns, and beer are simply the best fodder for countless hours of entertainment.  Wurstkuche provides an awesome venue for which the entertainment takes place.I'm pretty partial to beer halls having spent sufficient time stumbling from one beer hall to another in Eastern Europe.  Wurstkuche adds a modern industrial twist to the traditional beer hall though in more ways than one.  The open layout and countless rows of picnic table style seating is similar, but the downtown industrial feel adds a gritty chic to the experience.  The sausages are not to be messed around with either.  If you like your sausages a little gamey, then you've hit the jackpot.  Rabbit/rattlesnake and crocodile are common fare, but their other sausages like the Spicy Austin are great.  The Belgian fries are solid and enhanced with some awesome sauces like curry ketchup.  Beer selections are solid, but I'd personally like to see more representation from other beer making stalwarts from behind the Iron Curtain like the Czech Republic.Parking isn't too difficult to snag in this part of town and it's easily within stumbling distance to many other restaurants and bars in downtown and Little Tokyo.  Whether you're intending to strap on your beer goggles and liederhosen and planning to polka til the last drop or just chilling with your superfly crew, Wurstkuche is where it's at."},{"date":"2013-10-08","rating":"5.0","review":"good brew. cool tables.art district vibe.must visit.never ate there cause i dont eat meat but i heard the food is great."},{"date":"2012-03-28","rating":"5.0","review":"I have nothing bad to say about my recent visit here.

Both safe choices in my book :) I tried the Filipino Maharlika with carmalized onions and sweet peppers on the side...and Boy was I happy!

I used to work right around the corner from here and we would always celebrate every birthday, successful client project, or even just a random Tuesday at Wurstkuche. All the vegetarian sausages are good, but my favorite is the Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sage topped with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. I found all the sausages to be slightly dry so I always smothered them with the delicious dipping sauces. The Pesto Mayo and Chipotle Aioli sauces are THE BEST. My colleagues and I used to literally fight over them all the time and have to order extra. The fries are cut thick and very crispy, making them among the best in LA, but don't bother getting the truffle oil because you can't taste it. Beer wise, I know I'm not an authority. I usually drink fruity, girly beer that tastes like glorified juice.  Regardless, Wurstkuche even caters to people like me. I love the Floris Apple ale topped with Fruli (strawberry beer) as well as the St. Louis Framboise (raspberry beer). Both are sweet and delicious. Happy Drinking!"},{"date":"2011-08-12","rating":"5.0","review":"Despite this place's name making me think \"most bad vag,\" it's pretty frickin' sweet. The deal is it's gourmet sausage and mustards and delicious beers. You order at the counter and then pick your own seat at one of four super long tables and your food comes when it's ready. There are amazing options when choosing your sausage (veg friendly included). I had a bacon, duck and jalapeno sausage and my friend had rabbit and rattlesnake with jalapeno. They were both fantastic, I liked mine better, but they were both good. Now not every sausage it that crazy, they serve straight up brats and stuff too.You can also order fries that come with special dipping sauces, the curry ketchup was kind of a let down, but it was good when you mixed it with the spicy mustard. The sweet BBQ was very good and the basil mayo was ridiculous, I kind of wanted to just eat the whole little dish of it by itself. There are 6 mustard types all scattered about the tables. And it was awesome because let me tell you I LOVE MUSTARD, I eat mustard sandwiches, on purpose. This place was awesome and while not a cheap meal, definitely not more expensive than any other sit down place that serves special beers and gourmet foods. Oh, I almost forgot, the bun was perfect. I love bread and this was one of the best buns I've ever eaten. It was soft and had just a tiny bit of chewiness to the crust. Enough toughness to make you feel like you weren't gonna lose anything but soft enough to be easy to eat.

The sausage was delicious, I had a Bratwürste topped with caramelized spicy peppers & onions, it was cooked to perfection. The sauces were to die for, the Blue Cheese & Bacon Sauce was out of this world. It was this really thick flavorful sauce that wasn't overpowering and had a perfect balance of salty, tangy and creaminess. You can put it on the sausage itself or even dip the fries, I did both and have no regrets. The only regret I had was not sneaking into the kitchen and taking home a vat of their sauce. This place is just terrific, you order your food in the back, you find a spot to plop down and they bring over your parties beverages and food.

Normally I'm not a fan of thick-cut fries but I finished the whole thing over my wurst sandwich.An enticing selection of wursts - although nothing traditional, definitely exotic. The buffalo and duck wursts were delicious! But I was disappointed by the rattlesnake and rabbit - very bland.

I am totally down for weird and different items. We finally were able to try Wurstkuche out since it is some what out of our way. First of all trying to find the place is a little tricky since it is located in downtown LA. The part that was difficult were the one way streets and if you missed the small street that Wurstkuche is located on, you would have to find your way back to the next one way street back to your original destination. After arriving at our destination we step in and the place in the front doesn't quite give out the restaurant feel. Initially the place looks like a wannabe deli serving sausages. The menu was very thorough as it differentiate the different types of dogs they had to offer. I wanted to go for the most bizarre type of hot dog so I went with the rattle snake & rabbit dog. Every dog will allow you to get two toppings. Since I didn't have the knowledge what went well with my rattlesnake/rabbit dog, so I asked the person there what would best suit my dog. I was advised that the caramelized onions and sweet peppers were the best deal for that dog. I also ordered the Alligator & pork sausage with the sauerkraut and sweet peppers. Just for the experience we ordered  Belgian fries to complete the meal. After ordering, walking back to the dining area with our number (almost looks like an award) we find that the inside eating area was organized like a cafeteria with picnic tables lined up in the middle and along the walls there were individual tables. Almost every thing in that room did not have a symmetrical item. Everything had an interesting shape to it. When the food arrived I must day that visually I was slightly disappointed by the way things were looking. I was hoping that the sausages were more thicker and filled the bun to make a hefty looking dog. The Alligator & pork was the first one i tasted. The sausage tasted a lil strange as I wasn't used to the flavor of alligator. In a way I feel that it was still in its water (sewage). My friend asked me if it tasted like sewage and I had to agree. It wasn't bad, but the skin was lil tough. The snake/rabbit sausage was pretty good. There was a lil kick of the jalapenos that was thrown in and gave it the right taste for satisfaction. The toppings were nothing special so I am not sure if it made a difference or not. The Belgium fries on the other hand was awesome. They had a good consistency of crunch and volume of potato. Upon ordering the large order of fries they give you a choice of two dipping sauces. The better one of the two that we got was the cilantro mayo, it was delicious. Overall I think the place was very interesting. I think it gets real live in the evening since the place is open late and they serve Imported beer.

Our bill came out to $26.If you're really feeling foodie adventurous they do have alligator, rattlesnake and rabbit on the menu."},{"date":"2012-02-08","rating":"4.0","review":"Oh Wurstküche, how I have been craving you all week.  Ever since I decided to humor my friends and try it out with them, I have marveled at my newfound desire for German.  I've got to say, I didn't get adventurous, but at least I know that you make a good old bratwurst wonderfully.I even ran into a friend in line and then another in the eating area!  Who knew you were such a connector too?  The friends I went with had a good laugh when one of them got the Filipino and added Spicy Brown mustard... great photo op of her posing with \"Spicy Brown Filipino.\"I guess it's a curse of your own popularity, but I wish the seating situation was less challenging.  We stood around awkwardly like the outcasts in a high school cafeteria as we waited for some spots to open up."},{"date":"2014-07-11","rating":"5.0","review":"Always a winner in my book.

My old roommate told me that it's been voted the best place for a \"man date\" in L.A., and well ... yes, it was a bit of a sausage factory, in more ways than one. Upon entry, a huge refrigerator case full of take-home sausages greeted us. Behind the case was a flirty young guy taking beverage orders. I originally was going to get the Duvel Green, but he recommended the Duvel Special, so I ordered that instead. Good reccie! While I lack the appropriate nomenclature to define exactly what was so appealing about the beer, it sure complemented the sausage very well. And speaking of the sausage ... not being a big fan of rabbit, I went with the duck/bacon/jalapeno sausage, which was juicy and flavorful and had a subtly warm spice to it. Topped with caramelized onions and brown mustard ..... YUM. I have say though that the bun could've held together a little better, but that's a minor complaint. Also the fries were fantastic. I don't know what they're cooked in, but they were thick and sturdy and just a bit crispy--a rare, tasty combination.So I liked Wurstküche. Despite the loud, thumping music that could've been turned down a bit on a Monday night, it felt a little like Father's Office East to me, complete with communal tables and a nice, low-lit clubby vibe. The man-date assessment of this place is right on. Based on my observations last night, the ratio of dudes to women was pretty high, so ladies, head to Wurstküche if you want to scope some available guys and snarf down some tasty sausages while you're at it."},{"date":"2012-07-29","rating":"4.0","review":"Delish!  Fun for groups, amazing beer selection, something different, and a great place to bring visitors.The fries are not amazing, but the sauces are fun so I usually end up getting them anyway."},{"date":"2011-08-13","rating":"3.0","review":"Went here on a Friday afternoon. First impressions...very hipster. Feels like all of the customers don't have day jobs. Cool and neat looking interior, confusing and uninviting exterior.I've been here a few times and it tasted good each time.  I've had Rattlesnake and Rabbit, Mango Jalapeno, Austin Blues, and Vegetarian Italian.  I liked em all, the Rattlesnake and Rabbit was the best, and I really liked the texture of the Vegetarian Italian.  To be honest, I don't think I could tell the difference between them as far as what type of meat is inside.  Really, it's not THAT special, but it is a cool and unique place which I can appreciate.Additional Information: -dipping sauces are awesome (served with fries)-Good beer, and you can start drinking while you're in line!-They don't have a customer parking lot -It's kind of confusing if you are unfamiliar with this place.  You order at the cashier and then you walk through a hall to the dining area where your food will be brought to you.  When you get there, just look for hipsters hanging out by a door in line...that door is where you start.  Overall, it's a nice place to eat.  I will return ON OCCASION.  I'd give this place a 4, but I think it's a little overpriced. I find it very difficult to leave this place without spending less than $25."},{"date":"2012-01-03","rating":"4.0","review":"Coooool place!

The double fried Belgium fries are a must and the chipotle aioli is my go-to sauce of choice. I've tried the duck/bacon sausage, mango habanero, chicken apple sausage and the rattlesnake but of all the crazy selections, the Louisiana hot link is always delish. It has a lot of different spices and has a slight kick to it. The \"spicy\" peppers you can add are mild at best. However, allowing 2 free additive toppings is a nice touch to a quality snapping dawg.If you're looking to try a new beer, go to the bar in the dining area. The bartenders are more than happy to let you try the beers of your interest. I'm not a fan of communal seating especially during peak dining hours and for that I'm docking a star.

They have a lot of combination meats to offer, but unfortunately almost all sausages have some sort of pork in them, which isnt great if you are one of the many that doesnt eat pork. I had the rabbit and rattle snake sausage. It was pretty good, but the truth is that at the end of the day you really cant tell what kind of meat it is, and that goes for all their sausages. Its more about the spices, and of course what you put on it. Americans eat for condiments, and unfortunately like to limit themselves to a few common things.This place does offer you a lot more choices which is nice to see. They also have some decent beer on tap, and their fries are pretty good too. I would definitely come here again, though I would probably plan it for a time when it is less crowded.One major bummer is that inside they have a dj blasting a bunch of crap, making conversation difficult when all you want to do is chat with the people you went there with and eat your sausage. Someone didnt tell them that its not a dance club. Another bummer is that the outside eating area is non smoking. I feel like there are enough places indoors to eat to accommodate the non smoking crowd. But this place also serves beer, and a lot of people only smoke when they drink, and the tiny outside area would accommodate that percentage of people well in my opinion. But hey, what do I know? I only frequent a large variety of joints fairly often and take notice of what is good and bad for the customer!"},{"date":"2013-08-29","rating":"4.0","review":"2 words -BELGIAN FRIES!

Those same people will have real trouble with Wurstküche. Their problems begin right at the door, out of which I always see a line of \"hipsters\" (can't have that!) and guys in jeans and flip-flops (seriously, can we not have that?) snaking. The menu, which begins with \"good old\" bratwurst, eventually reaches such heights of sausage fussiness as apricot-ginger, rabbit-veal-pork-white wine, and vegetarian apple-sage, all ideally accompanied by not just fries -- we're too fabulous for that -- but duck-fat fries. With truffle oil. White truffle oil.Let's not forget the concept itself, which turns a meal as down-to-earth as meat in a bun with potatoes into the basis for an Arts District hot spot. You might find this all a repulsive conversion of the \"real\" into the \"unreal,\" but if so, my friend, I can't help you. I do suggest that you take a deep breath and practice focusing on the viscerally important parts of the Wurstküche experience: the rattlesnake-rabbit-jalapeño, the veggie chipotle, the bottles of brown mustard (swipe one from another table if you must), and the beers (\"biers\") with names like \"Kwak\" and \"Optimator.\"If you know how to properly approach Wurstküche, I reckon you know how to properly approach L.A. I extract my own best evenings not inside the building's stuffy back room but out behind it, on that strip of sidewalk they've they've turned into outdoor seating. Living in Santa Barbara at the moment, I've grown used to -- and terribly bored of -- al fresco tables all pointed toward the beach or whatever. This place's benches don't just look out on but exist of a piece with a downtown intersection. Alas, I understand the street has become less seedy than once it was.

I did enjoy the food there I might as well go there again next time and actually try their hot dogs and get a tasty treat at how good they are. The food looks very appetizing and the place is just huge which is always a good thing and it's a perfect place for a big group get together. It could get noisy but overall the atmosphere was casual and very comfortable. Sitting outside also helps if the place is fully packed.Oh and then at that one time we ate there everyone found out they actually had one dessert which was an ice cream cookie sandwich they got for someone who was celebrating her birthday that day.

Arrived around 10:30 and the line was still out the door, but it seemed to move quickly. This is more of a trendy hipster type place. Honestly, with the line out the door and booming music, you might mistake it for a nightclub. Sausages range from your simple bratwurst to the more adventurous containing rabbit, alligator and rattlesnake. I went with the Austin, a spicy pork sausage with spicy peppers and grilled onions. Sausage prices seem very reasonable. Beer menu seemed pretty good (although I am no beer drinker) I had the apple beer which tasted just like cider and was delicious. They also have Belgian style fries with a variety of dipping choices.

Also, the Belgian fries were supposed to be fried twice, but they weren't as crispy as I thought they would be for something deep fried 2x -- in and out's extra well fries have more bite and crunch. Though I have to give props for the truffle oil - that was reallly good.In the end, though, you are paying a pretty penny for what really is just a glorified hot dog.

KILLER!  Downright addicting.  My gf's Rabbit/Veal sausage was very light and finely textured. I think the veal really stood out more than the rabbit.  A slight gamey after taste... just slight.  My gf didn't like it too much.  I thought it was ok.  The fries are nicely crisped with a soft interior.  Thicker cut like steak fries.  The curry ketchup kind of overpowered the fries.  But it was a nice curry taste.  The pesto mayo was cool, refreshing, and had a hint of cucumber flavor mixed in.The food may not be expensive, but it isn't cheap either.  I'll definitely be back to try out all the other flavors.  So that's what... 8 or 9 more visits?"},{"date":"2013-07-22","rating":"4.0","review":"Fun, beer and interesting sausages.  It is a little pricey but definitely worth a try if you haven't been."},{"date":"2013-09-23","rating":"4.0","review":"Wow talk about good times.!  Stuffing your face and beer.  Not to mention s lean and friendly environment! !  Try everything and leave big tips!  It a blast!"},{"date":"2011-06-05","rating":"4.0","review":"not what i was expecting thats for sure. real cool vibe. tried four sausages. best one was filipino with hot peppers. awesome fries. best sauces were the bleu cheese walnut and the chipotle aioli."},{"date":"2011-07-20","rating":"3.0","review":"My friend Andrea was having a wienerfest for her 33rd birthday, and what better way to celebrate a sausage fest than at Wurstküche?  I had eagerly awaited the opportunity to get in there and get some exotic street meat, and enjoy every single bite, tip, buns and all.  I had avoided this place due to rampant hipster posturing and the long lines, so now was my chance.We got there and the line was manageable but still impossible long ... long enough it made some of us have to think twice about eating there as we had appointments to make.  All in my immediate party stuck it out though as it was a birthday party.I ordered the exotic on the menu that has buffalo in it with sauerkraut and onions, a veggie something or other for my always impossibly late girlfriend (she was not at the counter with me), truffle oiled fries and a Bitburger.  I was immediately struck at the damn good beer selection, but wanted to stick with something on the lighter conventional side as I've been drinking a bit too much beer lately.Now, I love wieners as do many of you,  but I think I'm a victim of hype here.  I felt underwhelmed when I took my first bite and immediately was turn off by having too much bun in my mouth.  The truffle oiled fries were fantastic as was my chipotle aoili sauce, but I was saddened my sausagefest was not the kind of party I wanted it to be.  Just to be sure, I put some other kinds of wieners in my mouth but I just wasn't feeling them.3 stars.  The food arrived promptly, the service for beer in the line was a nice touch and the fries were out of this world, but I think hype and the overall line situation deflated my wiener wonderment."},{"date":"2011-09-18","rating":"4.0","review":"As I stood in line outside, I kept asking myself, \"is this worth it for just a hot dog?\" Oh, shame on me, it's soooo not a hot dog!

Oh, your Angeleno friend also wants you to eat half of her green chillies and cilantro smoked chicken & turkey sausage because she recently ate? Ok.So, sure, you may have majorly lucked out by going at the perfect time on a Saturday when there were only 4 people standing in line inside (versus spilling out the door and down the block, as I was told is the usual scenario), and thus were served your grub pretty quickly after you'd been photostrolling up and down and around the warehouses for the past several hours and had worked up quite the hefty appetite, but Wurstküche is solid nevertheless.Only slight qualm about this place (and I say slight because everything was still great): I couldn't quite distinguish anything unique-tasting about the rattlesnake and rabbit compared to other sausage meat. But maybe it's just I didn't know what I was expecting. Or maybe that was the whole point of them being in sausage form together.

Worst of all are the ancestral cravings for encased, seasoned, meat product boiled in beer and served on a bed of fermented cabbage with a side of kartoffel. While it does not completely fill this void in my life, Wurstküche puts forth a tasty effort. Husband-elect and I arrived with a large group of birthday revelers, late on a Saturday night, and a bit tipsy (to be fair).  Orders and payment was taken at the counter near the entrance and we were given a number then sent off to find our own table. I ordered the vegetarian Mexican chipotle sausage with hot peppers and sauerkraut and a klein order of fries with chipotle aioli. Ordering the hot peppers was not a good idea (my own damn fault) and far too hot for this fräulein. Sadly, the mustard choices listed on the menu were nowhere to be found.The dining room was crowded and dimly lit, but we found a table without too much trouble. The food arrived quickly and was quite yummy--the fries in particular. The aioli sauce is highly recommended. Oh the fries were so, so delicious and perfectly crispy. So delicious, in fact, that we stole some off the plate of a friend at our table. The sausage was also very good, but I had to remove some of the hot peppers because apparently my tolerance of spicy does not match my desire for it.

We passed on the fries because we had to make room for the beer....lots and lots of beer. I ordered the bockwurst and the duck, bacon & Jalapeño  sausage. Topped the first with Sauerkraut and the second with grilled onions. Friend ordered the Buffalo, Beef & Pork with Chipotle Peppers and the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers and fixed em up with the same toppings as i had chosen.  We walked to the back to find a seat and ended up sitting at the bar because the place was packed. Worked out well because the beer we ordered was so big it literally took three hands to lift it up to take a sip. The food came out rather quickly, stumbled to find some mustard and started nomming! OMG...everything was soooooo good. We each had our favorites. I loved the texture of the bockwurst but the buffalo was damn good too.  The rolls that the sausages came on had a nice crunch but were super fresh. I liked the Sauerkraut, not super intense...just right and the mustard was very tasty as well.Yeah this place is pretty good. Simple and tasty, nothing more.

Or maybe I'm just spoiled. My husband is Magyar, so believe me, I've had my share of the Hungarian variety while traveling through Central Europe. The Astro-Hungarian links are generally sizable, sometimes spicy, often fatty, full-flavored and fresh, on occasion too dry, but that's usually when they're reheated in the oven with all the other pork products. Sausage and Salami are our household staple. So I think I know my encased meats.When we got to Wurstkuche we encountered the requisite ten-minute line. No big deal, after about five minutes a woman takes our drink orders and voila, a minute later we're all holding tall glasses of Fruli (a beer fermented with strawberries). My two friends aren't big beer drinkers so they loved it. I thought it was a bit too sweet. For sausages we had the Mango Jalapeno, Louisiana Hot link, Austin Blues, and Kielbasa. They all passed the test: flavorful, juicy, and easy to swallow.We split each one three ways and it worked out perfectly.  Next time, I'd skip the Kielbasa because it's too pedestrian.

Sausages! I smell sausages! I want to eat lots of sausages! Good thing they only serve sausages and french fries. The two entrances are confusing but conceptually I am inlove with the floor plan of the building, and whatever designer did the interior and the theme. I am in love/possibley a little obsessed with the twisted hard red metal shapes in contrast to the soft natural wood. So fresh, so funky. I love that the long tables in the center of the restaurant are like cafeteria style, although it makes converstating with a group of over 4 difficult in that the people on the ends are trying to shove their heads in to listen and be a part. But there are other tables and booths for that so don't worry. The beer selection is FAN-FREAKIN-TASTIC! Man, I don't think I've seen a restaurant or pub recently that has so many of my favorite Belgian and German brews on tap and for reasonable prices. Their beer list teases me so. Waiting in a long line to order a sausage is kind of galling, but it's worth it. Once ordered you find a seat and hang out with your buds and try not to let the anticipation of nomming on ground up encased meats gnaw at you too much. But if you do, don't worry, you won't be disappointed. The duck bacon sausage is so hot and juicy and fully of flavor that your taste buds just might explode. It's a great sausage but I have to admit, the taste is not far from any other delicious regular sausage. The french fries are great aswell. I'm not usually a fan of soft french fries but these were great. Only thing I wish you guys had more of? Different kinds of german mustard. I mean you can't honeslty think that only 2 oe 3 kinds would satisfy my freakish mustard needs would you? Get some spicy brown, a hotter swet hot mustard, some deli-style, everything.

However you also see other people, there was this 5 year old kid waiting for someone next to the bathroom, when I was going to open the door he just screamed, \"are you going to use the boys bathroom\" thanks kid for relaxing the atmosphere a little, had you not been there the feel would have been more pretentious. If you're not from the area, I recommend eating a hot dog here with a beer, and then exploring the neighborhood, it's a really interesting neighborhood, a lot of native art around the area, it almost feel like a museum! Probably one of my favorite spots in Downtown!"},{"date":"2014-07-19","rating":"4.0","review":"chicken apple is my favorite with the house made mustard and fries."},{"date":"2011-09-27","rating":"5.0","review":"A haiku:You can drink their beerand eat their sausage but youcan't pronounce their name"},{"date":"2011-10-08","rating":"2.0","review":"Disappointed Yelper over here. I think this place is so overrated. Came here on a Thursday night around 7 pm. The line wasn't that long outside, but it moved really slowly. They hand out menus while you're in line so you can decide on your order, but it just made me more grumpy and hungry as I was looking through the menu.I had the sundried tomato and mozzarella with caramelized onions and sweet peppers, which were room temperature but my sausage was piping hot! Not a good combo. The sausage was more peppery than I expected. If I go again (big IF), I'm going to order the more exotic flavors. I think that's why people love it so much. Don't order anything ordinary here, order the weirdest thing on the menu (bison, rattlesnake, rabbit, etc.).The size of the dog is perfect for me, actually a bit too large and I had to give 1/4 of my dog to my buddy Steve, who eats 4x as much as me and wasn't very full after 2.25 dogs. So I guess this place isn't good for those with big appetites because it gets pricey if you want to get full. Also had the truffle fries with bleu cheese bacon & walnut - the sauce was super good! The truffle fries were OK, a bit too thick and soggy for my taste. I tasted too much starchy potato and not enough seasoning/truffle oil.Lastly, Rebecca and I split the apple ice cream sandwich dessert. I really liked it, the vanilla ice cream had a wonderful creamy flavor that I love. Rebecca wasn't a fan of it though. The cookie was whatevs too. The vanilla ice cream is the star of the sandwich.All in all, this place is so overrated. Yes, it is very distinctly LA with the downtown-arts-district location, the dark ambiance, the trendy hipster crowd, and the exotic fare. So if you're in the mood to be an LA hipster, you should definitely go. Otherwise, I could get a better hot dog by a cart in Downtown. Dirty dogs wrapped in bacon and topped with STEAMING HOT onions and peppers is the way to go for me! Sorry Wurstkuche, here's one Los Angeleno that you failed to get on your bandwagon."},{"date":"2012-02-08","rating":"5.0","review":"Tried this spot a while back.

And this place is for all those who love all things to do with beer and sausage and all their various incarnations. This was my first visit here and I have to say one thing: the area and parking sucks big time!Finding this place was a nightmare and I suggest your first visit to this area not be alone and preferably with someone who either knows the area and or knows where this place is.  From what I've been told, this place is located in the art district of downtown L.A. and did not appear to be a safe area. Parking is limited so get there early or during daylight. They do have another location in Venice, but I have no idea how the area or parking condition is there. They have a very large selection of beers and good beers (so my man told me who drinks) too. They also have a good selection of sausages and this is where they excel. They take a little bit longer to bring your food to your table, but you'll understand why when you get your sausages. They do them the right way. I had the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage with saurkraut (sp), grilled onions and spicy mustard. My friend had the bockwurst with grilled onions and spicy mustard. They were both grilled, juicy, flavorful and very filling. They have more than 50 varieties of sausages, but not all available at the same time, so take your pick to see what's on the menu. The beers were plentiful and depending on who you are, pick one to complement your choice of sausage. From what I've been told, this place can get packed on Friday and Saturday nights, so please decide on what you want BEFORE you get to the counter. I had the unfornate experience of being behind a group of 4 women who couldn't decide what they wanted right up until they reached the register. Get there early and, if you can, go on off peak hours to beat the crowds. They do have a bar and seems to be popular amongst the young, hip and artsy crowd. That being said, would I come back again?? Yes, for the sausages. The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is the area it's in and the lack of parking. Otherwise, I love this place. Make Weinerschnitzel look like a poor cousin by comparison."},{"date":"2013-07-11","rating":"3.0","review":"loud... order in the backalways out of the snake sausagerabbit and something sausage was mediocre this place is more of hanging out with friends in a casual setting"},{"date":"2013-06-09","rating":"5.0","review":"Sausage was good, beer was varied (I'm a fan of the Red Duchess myself), atmosphere was neat (there's also a DJ for the mx.

Cool German picnic hall type setup with a turn table. I think a DJ comes at night and it's more of a hipster party type atmosphere, but I always come before 7 and it's nice and quiet.

Don't you think?  One man's foot long is one woman's 4'' po' boy.  Hey, just stating the obvious about the exaggeration-ginormous-generalis syndrome.  The human species seem to have a thing for stuffing pretty much anything they can think of into a place it doesn't belong, and leave it up to the Germans to do it while drunk.  Wurstküche is no different in that regards.  Let the wiener-fest begin!The Wieners:  We tried every exotic (7.50) plus two gourmet (6.50):- Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers -    average size, too small for the bun, but by far my favorite, 5 stars- Alligator & Pork, Smoked Andouille Sausage -    average size,  not too shabby, but too small for the bun, 4 stars- Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers -   on the shorter side, too small for the bun, 3.5 stars- Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned with White Wine -    average size, too small for the bun, 3 stars- Buffalo, Beef & Pork with Chipotle Peppers -    was on the shorter side, still too small for the bun, 3 stars- Mango Jalapeno -    the short runt of the litter - sweet and nice,    \"get outta here\" for the bun, 3.5 stars- Louisiana Hot Link -    by far the longest and the hottest, fit the bun nicely, 4 starsAll 4 toppings (Caramelized Onions, Sweet Peppers, Spicy Peppers, and Kraut) were served separately to appease individual tastes.  All these toppers were superb!The Pommes Frites:  Belgian \"Groot\" double dipped fries (5.50-7.00) were ordered with and without White truffle oil glaze.  Couldn't really tell the difference except one was darker than the other.  Sauces from the best first were:  Chipotle Aioli, Bleu Cheese Walnut and Bacon, Sundried Tomato Mayo, and TzatzikiThe Drunks (not a typo!) from best to so-so:- Chimay Grande Reserve (Blue) - Rich, strong, dark, awesome- St. Bernardus ABT 12 - rich, dark, semi-sweet, satisfying- Delirium Tremens - a lighter ale- Floris  Apple Ale - just a tasty apple punch - Früli - bitterly sweet strawberry punchThe total damage was $89 which included two Chimays but excluded St. Bernardus, Delirium, and the fruit punches.  So this is NOT your everyday trip to Wienerschnitzel!In the end, the size and variety of wieners were as diverse as the people eating them.  One out of the seven dogs was a 5-star experience, overall - I would say 4 stars for the variety of exotic meats, ale choices, excellent counter service, and the two huge out-of-place wieners dressed as bouncers in silk suits that answer to Manny and Moe - The club is down the street!  But I have to admit, I can see why they were there - the place was packed to the brim like a can of Vienna Sausages."},{"date":"2014-06-08","rating":"3.0","review":"i went here a while ago and had a sausage with alligator that i don't see on the menu now. anyway,the first time i tried alligator sausage was from New Orleans and i loved it and this sausage was mixed with some other meat that i don't remember but it was still good. the fries are great. i like the chipotle aoli and pesto mayo. it does get extremely busy and that's annoying but i'd go back. still lots to try."},{"date":"2014-08-13","rating":"5.0","review":"Awesome choice of unique sausages, huge German beer selection on tap.

Luckily it moved pretty fast, giving us just enough time to review the menu and decide what we wanted before it was our turn to order. The hostess by the door was incredibly helpful, and she recommended an amazing beer (I think it was the Reissdorf Kolsch) that was exactly what I wanted.I ended up ordering the sun dried tomato & mozzarella, while my friend went the more adventurous route and tried the rattlesnake. I think we both agreed that mine was better than his -- while both were good, mine had more flavour and a nicer texture to it.

We went on a Wednesday night around 9pm and there was still a line outside. It didn't take us very long to get to the register but still, how does this place ALWAYS have a fatass line outside? I'm almost sure if they just had random meats in there (as long as they had different textures like softer, or more chewy, etc) people would still \"Oooo & ahh...\" at the \"exotic meats,\" even if it was really just pork or beef or something. I'm not sure if anyone is really skilled enough to distinguish the crazy meats- alligator, rabbit, and rattlesnake... but I guess it's worth trying just so you can have bragging rights about eating some crazy aligator.

It was a lot bigger than I expected, and a lot louder, and had less of a beer selection than I expected. I went for a large birthday party and had a pretty good time. I guess it just didn't live up to the expectations I had for it though.I arrived before the rest of the party so I grabbed a beer (St. Bernardus ABT 12) and a corner table. This place is BUSY. It was a Friday night, so it was supposed to be! The party started trickling in, and we had a table reserved, so that worked out perfectly. My boyfriend ordered me a Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sage sausage and when he told me that I was like wtf, what is the one fruit I don't like! He was all, just wait, you'll be fine, it's not like it's made of apples. He was right! It was delicious. He got me the sweet peppers on top. And then I piled on the mustard, especially the chunky one. I love chewing my mustard! And the fries were good, but I've had better batches. There were a lot of little crunchy ones, and that is not the Belgian fries way. But the dipping sauce was awesome, of course. We got the chipoltle aioli and the tzatziki (meh), and our friend got the Thai peanut and that was REALLY GOOD. I then had a glass of Duchesse de Bourgogne, one of my favorite beers. Love that beer. My boyfriend continued to drink, drink, drink, with the rest of the party, but I wasn't feeling it. I sipped some of his beers, including Old Rasputin on nitro and that was extremely robust and creamy. A great one to put on nitro in my opinion. The place is really big, and is great to accomodate the tons and tons of people who go through there. The dj was not very good, and the music got progressively louder as the night wore on. It got way too loud, especially for the way the tables are set up. They have long and wide picnic type tables so if you're trying to talk to anyone who isn't right next to you it's pretty impossible by around 10. We had a pretty big party, too, so the group was kinda split up due to the shape of the tables. It was nice that they had the space for us though, and that they took reservations. The birthday boy planned that out a while in advance, I believe. Overall, it was alright. I don't know that I would go again.

It was hard to find seats, and the ones who were already eating, drinking and socializing were loathe to make room for two more people.  So we sat at the bar, and there we had a very courteous and pleasant experience eating and drinking more.My bratwurst was perfectly cooked in a steamy bun served with sauteed green peppers and carmelized onions.  A generous serving of Belgian fries with two dipping sauces (one was like a thousand island, the other tasted like chipotle ketchup) were delicious.Most of the beers are priced between $7-$11 dollars.

Who knew this place existed in Little Tokyo!Mind you I've only tried mango jalepeno sausage and Belgian fries (chipotle mayo!) with a Koestritzer (if you fancy a darker ale); the sausage was juicy with bits of mango and jalepeno delightfully bouncing on your taste buds-- a wonderful marriage between the two flavors. I've also tried kielbasa, and polish. I guess I was too chicken crap to try the exotic stuff...They have a huge stein for $5. I think the giant mug it's served in is about a liter... see it for yourself! I'm a dark ale girl myself.I don't suggest going on the weekend if you don't want to face the long lines. I mean, long lines also mean very limited parking around the area.Rattlesnake dog, I'm looking at you next.

Just a few years back my only lunch options were Korean BBQ in Little Tokyo or a bag of chips from one of the many crack-head laden liquor stores near by. Now? Now, I get to choose 2 sauces for my Belgian fries. And for that I thank you Wurstkuche. Thank you for not one but 3 veggie sausage options. Thank you for that extra side of sauerkraut. Thank you for that serving of apple beer that was just enough to be relaxing and still allow me to return to work in an operable state.

Went here randomly when a friend heard me talking about my love for curry ketchup (that's real love, yo). Here are some things that are the coolest things ever about this place:1. Their selection of beer - no comment necessary 2. They serve you beer while you wait in line - this should really be standard for all queues including: bank lines, Disneyland lines, grocery store lines. 3. Their menu - good variety of le sausage exotique and french fry dips4. Layout - pretty much just an indoor beer garden.

This has been on Yelp, heard about it being in the L.A. Times. There MUST BE something good about this place? I was really excited to try this place out. I was expecting to finally have a \"sausage haven\" to go to and enjoy some good food with a beer, or ten.First, the \"front\" of Wurstküche is very un-assuming. It's a doorway (with people probably waiting in line) that goes into a small \"waiting room\" / kitchen. There, you place your order for food and your drinks. There are a lot of types of sausages. Snake/Rabbit being on the more exotic side. Oh, is that Pomme Frites I see? Nice, I haven't had these since my last visit to NYC. Beer in a goblet? Um, cool? Also while waiting in line, you can get some of the refreshing Cucumber water that's there for patrons (you'll need it for the wait). If that didn't sway you from placing your order, do it, then walk down the hall to the \"main dining room\". There's a bigger bar with tables (not much), but this gets packed just as quickly as the front (to place orders).So, after waiting in the long line (20 mins or so), I finally ordered. I chose a Bratwurst, a small order of Pomme Frites, and a Chimay. All, for about $17 and change. Yes, this better be good, or I just got ripped off. So I wait. Wait some more. Yeah, you guessed it, waiting some more. In a span of almost an hour (I'm not kidding), my food finally is made and served. Bratwurst, was good, right amount of spice and snap. Bread was a little on the tough/hard side, overall, B+ (for Bratwurst + something would have made it so much better). Pomme Frites seriously lacked in texture and seasoning? It was like having mushy fries with no seasong. Epic FF (for Fail Fries!!). Chimay? It was a really good beer. C (for my Cheapa** should have bought a Pabst from the liquor store across the street for a couple of bucks instead of spending 12!).Overall, not the worst place on Earth, but I expected better and have actually had better (at home). Will I come back? Maybe, if someone's willing to pay for my tab. Otherwise, I would be at home making my own kind of sausages.Parking is near non-existent, but that's how it is in this part of L.A."},{"date":"2011-08-21","rating":"4.0","review":"Soo gooodddd! A friend of mine introduced me to this place and after giggling immaturely at the name for a few minutes, I peeked at the menu and was instantly intrigued. I'm vegetarian so it's super rad that they've got a mini veggie selection at a hot dog place. I got the veggie chipotle and it was deliiiiccccioussss! Definitely recommend it. Its also fairly large unlike your baseball stand sized hot dogs.Their beer selection is marvelous. I tried their Belgian amber, Kwak, and their Reisling. The Reisling was alright, nothing to rave about but their Kwak was super yummy and one of the best Ambers I've had to date. The seating area at the place is pretty unique and if you've got personal space issues this place probably isn't for you. They've got 2 long giant picnic table style benches so it's sort of an interesting experience sitting next to strangers as you scarf down hot dogs as classily as possible.

The name sounds like \"worst coochie,\" which is funny on a lot of levels. I remember seeing the building as it was still under construction whenever I'd drop by the neighboring E3rd Lounge, with signs alluding to a forthcoming sausage house...needless to say I was skeptical. Very curious, but mostly skeptical. It's located in Little Tokyo's Arts District, which has been cleaned up a great deal and is now quite hip, but still undeniably sketchy, so take your iPod inside with you.Basically, you look over the menu while you're waiting in line, order your sausage, sides and beer at the counter, then find a seat in the always-crowded dining room. After waiting in line a good 20 minutes (not bad for dinner on a Saturday, actually), I walked in with every intention of trying something out of the norm. Thus, I opted for the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage. Long story short, it pretty much tasted like bratwurst. The upside? It tasted like really, really good bratwurst. I regretted not ordering two. The belgian fries were small portion wise but Delicious and  we loved selection of dipping sauces provided.M: I had the duck/bacon sausage, which i enjoyed.  Not your typical sausage but i took a bite out of B's rattlesnake/rabbit and seemed to enjoy it more than mine.  The decor is creative. It walks the fine line between minimalist and industrial, with a private dining \"atrium\" for small parties carved into one of its corners. It was a nice night, so we sat on the narrow patio that runs along the side of the building. The inside boasts a large bar and a DJ on weekends. HUGE import beer selection, our favorite of which was the Delirium.With huge selection this place has to offer, we'll most definitely be back.loft309.wordpress.com"},{"date":"2013-04-05","rating":"3.0","review":"Rating based on sausage only: 5 stars.Rating based on ambiance-only: 2 stars.Rating based on Belgian fries-only: 2 stars.One of my friends and I decided to have dinner here last Saturday at 8pm.  Parking can take awhile to snag on the street, but it's do-able if you refrain from thinking about the neighborhood you're surrounded by.  The line though, was out the door - and we waited around 30 minutes.  The reason for a line is that you order right by the door, and they only have two cash registers.  So, the line naturally forms out the door.  So... you order at the register, pay, they give you a number, and you go down a hallway to the dining area.  It's communal dining, with a few separate, small tables around as well.  It's dark, but nice.  But it's not cozy.  Or fun.  Or anything enticing.  The crowd is relatively young, and yes, hipster is the common theme in LA these days it seems.  The hot dog is very good and priced well for the quality, but I wouldn't jump to return only because I didn't enjoy spending time there.Now the food...    I went with the rattlesnake and rabbit one.  I mean, c'mon, how often can you get a sausage like that?  Or anything with those ingredients, right?  My friend got the chicken mango one.  We split an order of Belgian fries.  It doesn't take too long before they bring the food.  The portion is kind of small, but it's actually correct for humans.  I'm so used to seeing Shrek-like portions everywhere.  The bun is very good, soft, and fluffy!  The hot dog itself was incredibly good.  The flavors and creatures were so in sync with each other, when in mortal life, they were arch enemies.  Buttery, rich, yet not heavy.  It was slightly spicy, but not really anything to speak more about.  You get the (free) option of ordering it with caramelized onions and sweet or spicy peppers.  I did, and with sweet peppers.  Fantastic!  If I worked in the area, I'd surely lunch on this on a weekly basis.  My friend liked her chicken mango sausage, but said it was more spicy than she expected (and she does not like things to be too spicy, if that helps you).  The Belgian fries weren't bad, but they weren't anything good, either.  And I nearly salivate and ooooh and aaaah at every basket of fries in front of me, whether In n Out or some fancy shmancy place.  But these?  They look good, nice and dark and crispy on the outside, but they're mush on the inside.  They're not thick or thin fries, but more on the thick side if you made me choose a side. The dipping sauces are fun.  The blue cheese walnut one was just ok, and I thought it'd be my favorite.  The chipotle aioli was great.  All in all, if you're in the area and there isn't a line, go.  P.S. They brought samples of the Austin Blues sausage while we waited in line... and that one is also incredibly good!  Much spicier, but a good spicy.  Full of flavor.  I like how the sausages here are not greasy.  They definitely have taken the time to make sure they provide quality."},{"date":"2011-10-14","rating":"3.0","review":"You know that movie that everyone tells you is the best thing since... blah blah blah... and you finally go watch it and it's just blah?

Every time I walk in I'm greeted and someone asks if I want explanations about the sausages. It isn't a pain or condescending since they have a variety of sausages and meats.

I've never had a hard time finding a table whether its a small group or a large one. The food comes quickly and is delicious. The Belgian fries are great and I always order the Curry Ketchup to dip them in. Thankfully they only have one desert (an apple ice cream sandwich?) so I'm never really tempted, but i hear they are good.They've got cucumber water in the corner and it's always refreshingly cold.  The atmosphere is super chill, a tremendous mix of people- families eating an early dinner by 5 and then a hipsterish crowd after.It can be a bit pricey- about $20 per person, but I think it's worth it. Also, parking can be spotty.

 At 10.5% ABV, it'll get you DRUNK!!!  It's meant to be sipped, especially with the sweet fruits invading your mouth.On the next visit:-Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned with White WineIt wasn't spicy and because of that, I think I was able to enjoy the rich and complex flavors more fully.  It was surprisingly my favorite that evening.-Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno PeppersIt reminded me of chili or Mexican food, so I surmise that cumin might have been a predominant spice used.  I wish I could taste more bacon, but that's my futile philosophy.  Like money, I can never have enough bacon.  It wasn't too rich, but it's got plenty of flavor.-Alligator & Pork, Smoked Andouille SausageIt's as Cajun as can be.  The hickory smoke begged to sidle up near a pretty stack of pancakes and syrup.  I don't know.  Maybe hickory and maple go well together as entwined trees tower beneath the starry sky.  BAM!  I gahr-ron-tee my poetry skillz is progressing mighty fine!-Tripel KarmelietIt's golden-orange colored, citrus-like, bold, but not over the top, and very drinkable.  This seems like one of the more perfect Belgian Tripels out there.  I don't know about you, but it sounds like an impossible skating trick.  Just make sure you don't give your lov-ah anything less than a perfect 10.0.  Best cooch!!!_____-Buffalo, Beef & Pork with Chipotle PeppersHad this on January 21, 2012.  It's a decent sausage especially with the caramelized onions and sweet peppers, but the cumin and other spices seemed to mask what I wanted to taste out of the buffalo, beef and pork.  Of all the exotics I've tried, Rabbit, Veal & Pork win.  I shall try the oversized bockwurst next time!!_____-Austin BluesMay 9, 2014.  Just enough spice.  Great balance.  The bread continues to provide great texture and flavor.  2nd favorite."},{"date":"2014-02-03","rating":"3.0","review":"I don't know what the hype is??

What bumps this review up?  Easy.  THOSE DAMN BELGIAN FRIES!!!  Wowwww.  I seriously wished we just sat with 2 large orders of those fries with the truffle oil and our beers.  We just couldn't stop ourselves!Note when you order your beer that the Belgian beers are about half the size of both the German & American beers.  So if you're looking for a better bang for your buck, German & American is the way to go!Parking... is parking in LA.  Parallel parking, HAVE YOU HEARD OF IT, SUCKA?Avoid Saturdays if you can!  The lady taking beer orders at the front said it's pretty much busy EVERY Saturday."},{"date":"2013-06-30","rating":"4.0","review":"This place is solid.  Good sausages (my fav's are the kielbasa and Austin Blues), great fries and a sweet beer selection!  They make their own sauces, I'm a fan of the Chipotle Aioli...i'm pretty use they put crack in it.  The only downside that I can think of is that it can get really busy,  especially at lunch and if you are in a time crunch....don't even think about it."},{"date":"2011-05-23","rating":"3.0","review":"I liked this place quite a bit; nice atmosphere and good food. However, I cannot give more than three stars as I think it's a little overpriced, 'over-hyped' and you have to stand in line to order and pay.Well......standing in line isn't so bad, many great places are like that, but to me it doesn't really encourage a five-star review.The dogs are yummy, but again, nothing so unbelievably unequalled. Lots of other hot dog places equally good and that charge less than Wurstkuche. Plus, the sizes aren't really big; for $5.75 - $7.50, other places would give you something twice the size. Of course, you have to compare like with like (i.e. although the 50 cent hot dogs at Ikea are not in this league, they seem to be a better value.....). and I think plenty of other places have just as good food but for less.And the beers........there are some cheaper ones but (for example) many are $8 for eight ounces.

The prices are pretty good considering the hype this place generates. Spend less than $20 on a meal that will keep you full (and possibly up) until the wee hours of the morning. Just one tip: get there before sundown to get a prime spot in line and your own picnic table in the back. Upon my first visit, which was last night, I tried the chicken & turkey sausage made with green chillies and cilantro; the buffalo, beef, & pork sausage with chipotle peppers; and the hot Italian sausage--each ordered with sweet pepper and caramelized onion toppings. I also sampled both the regular Belgian fries as well as those glazed with truffle oil. I washed it all down with a sweet blossom elderflower soda (perfect sweetness, very crisp).The chicken/turkey sausage was good. The casing was a bit thick and the flavor a tad lackluster. It took a few tries to break the link with my teeth, which resulted in a gooey pile of the aforementioned peppers/onions on my tray. The buffalo sausage, however, was absolutely delicious: tender and bursting with flavor. It was the perfect percentage of smokiness and was exactly what I expected from Wurstkuche. Finally, the hot Italian sausage was excellent. Spicy pepperoni flavors = heaven!The Belgian fries were decent. As a well-known lover of fries (any fried food, really), I was hoping that this would be the piece de resistance of the place. I wouldn't say I was disappointed, but there were far too many overdone pieces and it was just a bit too greasy in my opinion. That didn't stop me from making two trips to the order line, however! Out of the sauces I tried (chipotle aioli, bleu cheese walnut and bacon, sundried tomato mayo,  and tzatziki), I really, really enjoyed the chipotle aioli and tzatziki. The chipotle was smoky and dimensional and the tzatziki was fresh, light, and surprisingly great with fries. As a true truffle lover, the glazed fries left me wanting more. I expect any truffle-laced food to possess a deep and earthy flavor that lingers far after it is consumed. I barely noticed it. Oh well. For dessert: toasted apple pie ice cream packed between two oatmeal raisin cookies. Again, left me wanting more. The cookie flavor was too overpowering when combined with the simple, smooth, and elegant flavor of the ice cream. I ended up scraping off the cookie and only savoring the filling. All in all, a great experience!

So much flavor and just the right spice.We ordered the \"large\" fries i guess with the chipotle aioli and blue cheese bacon dipping sauces. The chipotle was definitely good, the blue cheese, eh not as good.It was a pleasant surprise to taste a hint of cucumber in their water cooler instead of the usual tap i would expect from hole in the wall joints.Overall, top quality/great food at a very reasonable price.

I've always been a fan of the sausage, and I really liked our Alligator & Pork and Rattesnake & Rabbit sausages. Utterly delicious, on a fresh and soft roll, topped with savory peppers/onions/sauerkraut... This is the kind of simple, yet exotic, eating that I love best. Minimalistic gourmet. Yum. The fries, too, were excellent--and we enjoyed the bleu cheese walnut & bacon sauce that came with. Even the selection of mustards was great.Another fun component is the beverage selection. While neither of us had any of the assuredly premium beers, we did have fun with some rather unusual bottled beverages, particularly my Dandelion and Burdock soda. There's a variety of interesting drinks to be found, including old time sodas such as Moxie. Nice for any beverage enthusiast.My singular complaint of the place is its price. While it's not something I would be unwilling to pay, it seems a bit much to pay $8 for a sausage, especially one that doesn't leave you exactly full. The soda, too, was $5/bottle. So while in the realm of reasonable, Wurstkuche definitely pushes against the outer limits. And blasphemous as it may sound, I really do like $1.50 Polish sausages at Costco (a childhood favorite), so something like this is a real splurge in comparison. But still, I really loved it.A small warning though: we had a bit of a hard time trying to find the place, because the address is nominally on 3rd St, but the sign isn't on the corner.

I WISH they had bacon to wrap the sausage like a proper LA dirty dog.The BF had a spicy Louisiana sausage which has pork, beef, and hot spices. Its a lovely red color under the sauerkraut and spicy peppers. He didn't think the dog was spicy at all. (7 bucks) The other sausage I tried was the rabbit, veal, pork sausage with wine... I had kraut & sweet peppers as toppings. The BF HATED it and said it tasted milky I thought it was fragrant, moist, and had interesting flavors... (8-9 bucks)We didn't get beer or anything, but I got a sweet strawberry soda and the date had a organic cola which had a strong ginger kick.

Unlike the overrated Pink's on La Brea, however, Wurstkuche is absolutely worth the wait. The servers even cruise up and down the line with samples of their crispy and rich Belgian fries, complete with twelve different dipping sauce options!Once inside, the set up is similar to a cafeteria. You can order a beer (they carry a vast selection of craft and imported brews) and drink it while you wait to order your sausage. When you get to the front of the line you place your order, grab a number, and head down a cramped corridor that opens onto a great hall. Picnic-style tables line the open floor, almost guaranteeing you a seat next to a complete stranger. All of this sounds kind of overwhelming, but it adds to the overall communal ambiance.But let's get down to what's really important, and that is the sausages. The meat at Wurstkuche is absolutely splendid - I recommend taking a bite without the bun first to get the full flavor of the spices and seasoning mixed into each bite. Sausage options range from old favorites (like bratwurst and Italian) to exotic (alligator and pork, rattlesnake and rabbit). The buffalo, beef, and pork with chipotle peppers is juicy, tangy, and not so hot that it will burn away your taste buds. They also offer an array of different mustards to try with each bite. With so much on display, it's easy to get distracted by the sauces, condiments, and beers.

They're better than the belgian fries at Pommes Frites in New York; I just wish they had more delicious dipping sauces.

They're open late and I was just craving a good old hand held smacker of cuisine and came across this place whilst scouring Yelp. There was a tremendous amount of sausages to choose from including rattlesnake & rabbit for the more adventurous. They give you two toppings to choose from out of four and offer a truffle glaze for the fries in addition to your two choice of dipping sauces out of many. There is also four separate mustards on the table and of course, ketchup. We opted for chipotle mayo & sweet bbq out of the likes of sun dried tomato mayo, blue cheese bacon etc ... They informed me there was no more sauerkraut (we came at 1:00am) but my puppy dog pout did the trick yet again and the guy very kindly went to the trouble of going out to find some for me! Our food arrived after about 10 minutes. Whilst you're waiting there is a bar in the dining area complete with a DJ deck in this loft style lunch hall. I imagine the atmosphere is awesome in here during the day/early evening. There is also outside seating. I hadn't eaten all day and by the time our dogs got to the awesome picnic style table, I probably looked like Golem as I held the precious Kielbasa to my mouth ready to take a bite. JUICY. So juicy in fact that as I bit into it with relish it squirted in my boyfriend's eye. Yep. I squirted in his eye *two drums & a cymbal fall off a cliff* It was very good. The fries too were more like hand cut chips, thick and fluffy and extra gourmet with that hint of truffle oil. Despite snarfing it down, I could taste the wonderful miriad of flavours and spices, all decorated with a good slathering of mustard & ketchup.

The line to get inside was very long, it probably took about 15 minutes to get inside but as soon as we walked through the doors we were asked if we had a menu and if were ready to start ordering drinks. I ordered my La Trappe first,it was very good and had this sweet after taste AND it was one of the ones withthe higher alcohol percentage :)Ten minutes after i got my beer we finally got to the counter where you order your food.The guy was awesomely nice, cant remember his name though he helped me with my beer/hot dog pairing and helped me pick the best toppings and sauces.

I was in heaven.I felt the butteriness of the sausage in my mouth for a bit after my last biteI have no explanation for it yet. This has to be the best one here.I had my toppings on the side, so i piled a bit with every bite.My favorite mustard was their whole grain mustard..soooo good!Each bite was a little bite of heaven going into my mind.My friends sausage was a little too dry, maybe that's why they add he wine to thesausage. she added tons of ketchup so i really cannot describe it...FRIES- oohhemmmgeeeeeeeee!! white truffle oil glaze, double dipped fries!they are more like wedges, a little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside,perfectly seasoned.Curry ketchup was exactly that, perfectly balanced. No overpowering from eitherthe curry, or the ketchup. PERFECTION.Chipote Aoili was alright, just alright...I ordered my second beer halfway through my hot dog and it was a little malty but sat so well with the heaviness of the food.I would totally come back to this place at least twice a month :) there are so many items that I would like to try that I really need to come more often!"},{"date":"2011-12-28","rating":"4.0","review":"Wurstkuche. Although I live nowhere near this place, I've been there about a half dozen times. Largely due to a very close friends in-laws living nearby, and been invited to join them for lunch. Great local spot that has really exploded from when it first opened and I got a chance to check it out. Forewarning, if you go on some days, there WILL be a line to order. I would designate this spot as good beer spot (though nothing extreme, or rare that you might find at say Surly, Verdugo, Blue Palms, etc.), that carries some local So Cal brews from time to time (Bootleggers comes to mind) but mostly focuses on German Beers, along with a nice selection of Belgians. The main draw though is the food. You select what type of sausage, bun (or no bun) toppings, dressings, and any sides, along with your beer order. Your given a number for your food, your beer, and then have to find a spot to eat on the other side of the kitchen while you wait for your order. There is a 2nd bar there as well if your not interested in the food, but if you're at Wurstkuche, I highly recommend having food, since it's such a large draw, and is pretty good too. All in all, the spot brings a good amount of life ( and quality beer) to this neighborhood, that has seen some revitalization over the last 10 years. Growing up in the 1980's, the area was pretty run down, and while there are still some remnants of that, locally business seem to be coming back, as well as families to rent lofts, which is great, and Wurstkuche is a part of that community."},{"date":"2013-06-21","rating":"4.0","review":"Sausages + Beer = Happy me!  I wish there was a better parking situation in this area.

But nonetheless the food here was good especially the fries. Probably the best fries I've had to date, inside is soft and warm and the outside has the perfect crisp. You can get your fries cooked in Truffle Oil but the regular fries we ordered already tasted like it was, so I would suggest just sticking to the regular order. The dipping sauces we tried were the Chipotle Aioli (nothing special) and Bleu Cheese Walnut and Bacon (best dipping sauce, there's chucks of bleu cheese, walnut AND bacon). I would give 4/5 stars for the fries by itself. We also ordered Duck/Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers, Austin Blues, and Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle. The Duck/Bacon was expected to have more flavor, so it was disappointing when the topping had more flavor than the meat itself. The Austin Blues was delicious (salty and pork flavored). The Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle was SPICY (loved it though), the taste was very similar to chorizo . Another great thing about this place besides the fries is the atmosphere. The vibe is very LA, lighting is dark, seating is cafeteria style (with an industrial feel), and they have beers on tap. If you're not big on hot dogs/sausages, I would still recommend coming here just for the fries and to grab a beer or two to go with those delicious fries."},{"date":"2013-09-24","rating":"4.0","review":"Really cool place to hang out with friends.

Perfect. The rabbit i ate second so maybe because of that it was kind of dry but the taste was still there and although unique, i liked it. The exotic sausages are a bit more expensive though.

Everything about it is worth trying at least once. Wurstkuche is in the Arts District of LA, which seems really shady at first, but then you just realize it's really hipster. The people who come here are SO hipster. I feel like people come here just to be seen. I know I do.The line is usually ridiculously long, but as long as you have good company, it's not so bad. Their hot dogs are really unique. I don't know anywhere else that you can try alligator or rattlesnake meat. Then again, it all could just be pork and I wouldn't know any better. Their fries are all right - nothing special, but sort of necessary if you don't think one hot dog will fill you up.The seating area is a mess. You have to find your own seat, and if you have a large party during busy hours, it's pretty much impossible. The servers won't help you either and would more likely kick you out for a reserved area.

But don't come here for the food. They're trying too hard. This is a perfect example of too much and Wurstkuche is in desperate need of a lesson in restraint. All of the sauces and meat flavors are on the menu just for the wow factor. Some of them don't pair well and others don't even taste good. There was inconsistency in moistness and saltiness between orders of even the same sausages. Their fries didn't need any more flavor than the seasoning themselves. When you start adding curry ketchup  ...it's not a taste explosion in your mouth ...it's a train wreck on your tongue. All you get is third rate curry powder mixed with some Heinz. That's a great example of how Worste Coochie goes wrong. They've taken a bad turn on a culinary road and threaten to drive your taste buds right off an epicurean cliff. They need a driver with a sense of direction -better yet, a chef with some restraint and a good palate. They need to refocus on what tastes good and not just what looks good on the menu."},{"date":"2011-02-24","rating":"4.0","review":"Vurst Cuke? Vass Kook? Worst Koochee? No matter how you pronounce it, you cannot deny the deliciousness that is exotic wiener.You might want to be adventurous and try their alligator & pork sausage, but don't because it's actually dry. The other adventurous ones (duck & bacon, rabbit & veal) are also just mediocre and taste more like a regular hot dog. What I'd recommend are their gourmet sausages. The best are: Apricot & Ginger (with chicken, turkey, and lamb casing), Chicken Apple & Spices (can never go wrong with chicken apple) and Mango Jalapeno (chicken and turkey). I have yet to try their vegetarian sausages but next visit, these tasty sounding wieners are a must!I like their beer selection. It's no Father's Office but they have all the essentials. I had my very first Belgian here and it has changed me forever. Some of my personal favorites are Chimay White, Houblan Chouffe, Spaten Optimator, Allagash White, Tripel Karmeliet, and Unibroue La Fin Du Monde.Yes, there is a long line on the weekends (mostly from the other side of town... ugh).

At first I was a little skeptical, but since I heard some good things about it, I gave him approval in no time. There are different categories of sausages to order off from: from what i can remember, it is: classics, gourmet, and exotics. Having already eaten exotic burgers and not being a big fan of them, I chose the gourmet sausages.I ordered sun-dried tomato and mozzarella sausage and took a bite out of my friend's alligator and pork sausage. I still don't really know what the whole craze about sausage is, but it DID taste different than any other sausage I've tried. The sun-dried tomatoes added a nice gourmet kick to it. I like that there's options for the spiciness level and the options for 2 toppings/mustards.The beer!!!

I've tried the mango jalapeno, chicken apple, and Austin Blues. My favorite weenie was the mango jalapeno because it was sweet, spicy, and very juicy. My only complaint is that the weenie is oily. The chicken apple has a very tough casing, if you like that kind of thing. The austin blues was spicy but it looked like sweet bread (ie: they used the leftover parts to make the sausage), which may be true but nonetheless unappetizing. With your weenie, you can choose your toppings: carmelized onions, sweet peppers, hot peppers, or kraut. I wasn't crazy about any of them. Also, I wish the bun were less chewy. I feel like I'm chewing stale french bread. The dipping sauces are good. Don't just get ranch or bbq sauce! Try the chipotle ketchup, the curry ketchup, chipotle aioli, or the pesto mayo. So bad for you but soo good!The truffle fries are worth the extra $1.50. It adds a light hint of truffle, not overpowering, but just enough. They have a cool bottled soda selection. I tried the cherry ginger beer which had a lot going on. The peach soda was a winner, according to my friend. Ask the guys behind the counter for a soda recommendation; they're nice and friendly.If you are a KCRW subscriber, you get 15% off.

Here are SOME of what we've tried:The Belgian fries-it's so much better with white truffle oil glaze, order groot (large).  It's double dipped and fried to perfection.  Make sure to try the curry ketchup, it's very good and the curry flavor is not overpowering the ketchup.  They have quite a few selections but this particular one is a must!The gourmet and exotic sausage selections are the best! (It's not dripping on oil!)Alligator & Pork, Smoked Andouille Sausage alligator -some may find this chewy because of the alligator which tastes a bit like grass (seriously) but combined with the smokiness of the andouille sausage, the balance was perfection.   Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned With White Wine light -a little bit on the gamey side but nonetheless delicious.  The rabbit has a bit of slippery texture to it because of the fat.Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapeño Peppers -the snake is a little bit chewy combined with the fat from the rabbit makes this sausage delicate and flavorful with a bit of kick. Chicken Apple & Spices- just as what you would expect, apple slices with some cinnamon spices, good and juicy but nothing too crazy.Mango and Jalapeno w/ chicken and turkey -it was ok.  I love the sweet and sourness of the mango mixed with the spiciness of the pepper.The caramelized onions and peppers on the sausage are really nice as well, just another layer of flavor!It's a good place if you want exotic sausages!  4 stars for the variety and ambiance!"},{"date":"2013-07-13","rating":"4.0","review":"LOVE Wurstkuche even though I can't pronounce it!

So many great beers and a sausage to suit every need or desire. But the service model is inefficient and the line is stupid. I used to think it was long because the place was new and popular. Tonight; however, I dropped in about 20 minutes to closing. There was only one person in front of me, but it still took 12 minutes for them to order. They asked questions about each sausage, each beer, each dipping sauce and seemingly every other inquiry imaginable . . . . If that is multiplied by the 40 people who are in line during the lunch rush, it is apparent why the line is so incredibly tedious. I suggest getting at least one more cashier. Someone to work the line and answer questions before patrons get to the cashier would speed the process and free the cashier to deal with orders and money only.  It would behoove the establishment and the patrons to separate the beer service from the food at the counter. And, of course, one has to wonder why beer can be ordered and purchased at the back bar, but food can not? Unless it's an ice cream sandwich, which, nonsensically, is the only food item which can be purchased at the bar. I can offer one more novel idea. One that I've seen utilized in various restaurants around the world: table service. With the amount of obscure beers and sausages Wurstküche has to offer, they really owe it to both their product and their patrons to provide a streamlined service and let people who need to ask questions about the gourmet selections, ask their waiter, rather than waste the time of every other person in line. I would give this place five stars for the delicious food and great beers, but I go to this restaurant to eat and no matter when I show up, this gourmet fast food takes as long or longer than most sit down restaurants. The difference is, you stand endlessly, order, they give you a beer or a drink and a number to carry to the back, where there is often no seating. Alternatively, you might stand in line while your date saves a table. Not only does this make for a great date, but when you finally get to the cashier, she will not sell you a beer for anyone who is not present with an ID.I quit going there, because it is too annoying, inefficient and time-consuming. But, like Pink's, you need to brave the line to try these hot dogs at least once.

By this time, I was full but needed something to drink. So I hopped in line. Checking out their selections on the counter since I didn't want a beer, a Curiousity Cola looked good along with the Black Cherry soda. OMG the drinks I ordered were a total of $8.50. The Curiousity Cola was $5 and the Black Cherry was $3.50. Manhattan Black Cherry to be exact. Alright, I guess it's high end where I could've ordered one of those Jones sodas at the end of the display. The sausages do look very good though as I see them grabbing them out of the display box. Everything is mainly made to order where the sausages are all ready but uncooked. So they're on the grill for a little longer so it's thoroughly cooked. I thought that was cool but you can't come here hungry. You'll be waiting a while. As we were waiting for everyone's orders, the line kept growing. As I was in line and also waiting at the standing counter where you can eat, I saw how the beer is served. It's foamy right out of the spouts. All of them. \"Come back in 2 minutes, the beer has to sit.\" It's like telling you your beer is on time-out or something. So don't be thirsty either, you'll be waiting. I am not sure how to fix the foam problem since I'm not a bar keep or bartender but I would propose asking what others are ordering while waiting in line so you can start cooking the sausages. That's what I would do as the owner but then again, I don't have my own business either so don't shoot me with my suggestion. Don't get me wrong, I want to come back and try a sausage since the selections seem like a wide choice like my friend had alligator. There was rabbit and spicy ones.

Of course, that has its downside too, because it's just too close to our place not to go all the time! They offer a surprising amount of sausage variations ranging from the normal to the exotic (no seafood sausage [yet...]) but there are usually 2-3 veggie sauasages on the menu too, mustards (honey, yellow, grain, spicy), frite dipping sauces (blue cheese/bacon/walnut, BBQ/ranch, ketchups, aoilis, etc.), beers (high-end-organic, belgian, and even PBR), as well as fancy-pants sodapops. The first 2 toppings on sausages are free (carmelized onions, sweet peppers or saurkraut) or you can pay a nominal fee for all 3. The line is always out of control at night (after 7pm on weeknights and all weekend long during \"meal times\") so get there early and snag a  communal seat at the long tables/benches. The crowd is a mix of locals, USC kids and a lot of first-timers who have heard the hype. It would be great if you had to make up your mind *before* getting up to the counter, as that line can move really slowly. So far, I've always been able to get a seat, but sometimes you have to introduce yourself and ask people to slide over a bit. The communal nature of the tables makes people more friendly, I think. The staff and service is AWESOME. Their knowledge of beer will intoxicate you. They have special glasses for certain brews and can easily make recommendations based on what you like. Even if beer isn't usually their thing (try the Apple beer - it's like dessert!) My only (minor) criticism is that I really wish that I could get a pre-packaged side salad along with my sausage.

There was a decent line outside of the place and my friends and I had to wait a good 15-20 minutes. I got the Green Chillies & Cilantro hotdog with Caramelized Onions and Sweet peppers. The presentation of the hotdog itself was not that appealing and the taste was mediocre. Definitely a let down. The bun was whatever as well, nothing explosive about it at all.I did like the fries however, even though they were double fried, it still had a soft, starchy center. The Chipotle Aioli and Chipotle Ketchup were also nice complementary dipping sauces. I would probably go back to have a good beer and fries but not the hotdogs. The community style tables made the restaurant very lively and I did like the live DJ but if you want to eat good food while having a nice conversation with friends, this probably wouldn't be the best place to go."},{"date":"2011-10-05","rating":"5.0","review":"I don't know if I can say anything  2800 reviewers haven't already said...But this place is just ridiculously good!  Sausages?

I remembered Wurstkuche being in the top eats on Yelp and luckily it was close by! I definitely do not regret on skipping the ramen place. This is not your typical hot dog stand. My first reactions were hmm it is quite small, but little did I know that there was another area to dine. My bf and I probably waited about 30 mins. It didn't seem like it though because it took us awhile to figure out what we wanted to order. I ordered the sundried/mozzarella and my bf was daring to order the rattlesnake/rabbit with a side of their fries.I cannot give a completely honest review about the food because I was so amazed with the atmosphere of the dining area. It was definitely the trendiest place I've been to where I can enjoy a hotdog and some beer. I love that there was a separate bar to order more drinks. The lighting was dim, the atmosphere was cozy. This was the place to grab a bite and catch up with friends. My bf's hotdog was so good, better than mine! The fries were a bit on the thick side, but I loved the chipotle dipping sauce. My beer.... now I am so not a fan of beer, but I had to try the apple ale, and it was freakin delicious!!! Maybe cus it did not taste like beer at all haha. My bf always makes fun of me because I only like the drinks that are extremely sweet to the point where you can't taste the alcohol. And that is exactly how the apple ale was. I mean it wasn't too sweet, but it was just really refreshing. Wurstkuche is the place to go when you're in LA. These are the types of restaurant that keep me coming back to LA and how I am extremely jealous because you can't really find a place like Wurstkuche in the Bay Area."},{"date":"2013-05-03","rating":"4.0","review":"Delicious and an A+ for the atmosphere.

The way it works is that you stand in line to order your food; then you go down a narrow hallway to a  dining area that's brick and a bit industrial looking with bench style seating (outdoor seating is also available).  I had the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage  - it was slightly  bland for my taste so I had to combine the different varieties of mustard  to spice it up (I probably should have asked for hot peppers instead of sweet). My favorite item was the perfectly cooked Belgian style fries that came with 2 dipping sauces - I especially like the blue cheese walnut combo.   I didn't get the beer (which my friend said was very good) but  even my water was tasty (I think they  flavor it with cucumber).  We were there early afternoon so there was plenty of  metered street parking available (they accept cash/credit card).  The restaurant location near Little Tokyo is pretty  interesting with strikingly painted buildings.I can't wait to go back and the other types of sausage!"},{"date":"2012-01-17","rating":"5.0","review":"I know I'm here for a weiner review but the best part for me were their fries. Hands down, my favorite fries. So what happened was my friend and I went in absolutely starving which led us to poor decisions: we both got a sausage and large fries. I got the alligator & pork andouille sausage with carmelized onions and peppers. The link snapped when I bit into it and it was very tasty! On to the star of the meal...the fries! The large was a lot so don't order them unless you're ready to share. The double batter thing is magical because They. Were. Perfect. I didn't even need the fancy sauces, they were just beautiful.. *_*Oh, and the music. During college, I got to live in a house with friends in Boulder that played electro all day, erryday. Wurstkuche channeled that for me so it was nice and comfortable for me."},{"date":"2012-03-14","rating":"5.0","review":"Easily one of my favorite places to eat in all of LA. Quick Note: The Line at the Front is a Gimmick! I believe its just there to make it look popular, I've never waited longer than 10 minutes to put in my order, and never waited longer than 10 more minutes to receive my food, and that's fine because they give you your beer at the register!The sausages are to die for, as are the truffle fries, which you absolutely must try before you leave this town. Sausages come with two toppings, fries come with a dipping sauce. I recommend getting a large and splitting it with someone. The beer list is pretty fantastic and reasonably priced for what you're getting. This place can get expensive really quickly, I spent $40 on myself once.

Finding FREE parking was bordering on ridiculous, the line grew to out the door, and service took a bit because there were just so many orders at once.I almost chickened out and went with something safe like duck, but I went on and had the intended hit--rattlesnake and rabbit, and just in case I had some horrendous allergy to snake I never knew about (since I've never had it before) and therefore could not consume, I wanted to at least have some potatoes to eat for lunch.  I added the truffle oil and got the large fries just so I could pick two dipping sauces.  I'm sure there is a cheaper alternative to getting my two sauces, so lemme just own up to it now, I love me some fried potatoes :)When I bit into the sausage I thought two things: 1) the bun was gourmet, not like your average hot dog bun, I like, and 2) the sausage wasn't gamey.  THANK GOODNESS!  That would have been a deal breaker.  There was a nice spicy kick too.  Sometimes things are called spicy, but aren't this one was a good mild spice.  The sausage was surprisingly small.  I was not filled.  Fries were majorly hyped up by friends who had gone before.  It was blah at best.  Some pieces were soggy, some were burnt, and they were so stingy on the truffle oil.  The only thing I liked about their double dipped fries was the salt they used.  Very flaky, my money says sea salt.  Dips were good.  I hate ketchup with a passion, curried ketchup is the only way I'll enjoy that horrid concoction.  Chipotle aioli was spicy enough and not too tangy, can't complain.They must buy from Galco's?  I've seen every single one of their sodas at the shop.  Not a bad idea.  I'm not a big soda drinker but the quirky options had me sippin' on my soda pop while waiting for my food.Park on the street for free, hunt for parking.  Otherwise, there's a $3 lot down the street."},{"date":"2011-08-03","rating":"5.0","review":"This was a hidden gem a while back, but I think it's a little mainstream now because I came back for a recent visit and the line is down the street!?

I usually get the Rattlesnake and Rabbit. Might sound kinda crazy, but give it a try. It's delicious. The fries are great too, order the large and get 2 dipping sauces.

Love the hot peppers and the dipping sauces for the Belgian fries (Chipotle Ketchup is my favorite). Fun place with community style seating (there are some spots where you can have a bit more privacy) and a very nice patio. Line can be long depending on the time of day but they will take your drink order while waiting so you can enjoy a good brew to kill the wait.  The place draws an interesting crowd - all over the board in terms of age - every thing from hipsters to business people.  If you don't want to eat, they have a nice bar in the dining area in back.

I'd say the dress is anything from casual-cool to just after the office. The ambiance is amazing. But if you go during a busy time be prepared to share space. Most of the restaurant consist of two giant picnic tables from which everyone eats. It's very trendy cool, lighting rocks, and it has two bars from which you can keep your drink going. The staff rocks-and most importantly it's not understaffed. Don't let the line fool you it goes fast and the food is worth the small wait (15-20 min). My friend and I split two sausage dogs here just to try two different kinds and they both were awesome. Do not skimp on their double dipped fries and even spring for extra sauces. You get two with an order. The sauces wonderful. However, I must say the fries are so good you can eat them alone and still enjoy 100 percent.

Hey-- we like it hot! ;) topped with caramelized onions and... you guessed it- SPICY peppers. We had to get the Belgium fries, too, of course.The sausages are really great. They are fat, long (not as long as Costco hot dogs are though), juicy, and savory. I agree with other people when they say that the buns could be a little better (a little stale and plain tasting), but maybe they chose to make it that way so that it doesn't compete with the sausage. I found the Belgium fries to be too salty though. I was literally shaking the salt off the fries while I was eating them. I got the Chipotle Aioli (too mayo-y) and Curry Ketchup (\"interesting\" for a lack of better word). I loved the feel and decor of the restaurant. Imagine a modern lodge cabin with an industrial twist. Anyway, I loved the set up of the place. It's got tables for intimate parties, and long tables in the middle to encourage socializing!

I ordered the Louisiana Hot Link with Onions and sweet peppers.The service was friendly and quick, and I filled up my cucumber water and sat at a community picnic bench in no time at all.  The dining area is clean and plain, but has a rugged, woodsy feel to it.  It took about 15 minutes for my order to be delivered, at which time I took a bite and took the rest to go, since we didn't want to be late.Considering it's just a sausage in a bun, $7.50 a pop is kind of steep to me but then again, it's supposedly freshly made and cooked, and served to you by friendly workers, so they can charge whatever people are willing to pay... of course, it'they have variety of unusual sausages here as well, so maybe it's worth the price to have the option to try something like snake or alligator.  I think I'll give that a go next time."},{"date":"2011-05-17","rating":"4.0","review":"Great idea for a restaurant!

Probably not. But I'm going to put my two cents in anyway.I usually don't like things that are way too LA/trendy and wayyy too popular... but I like Wurstkuche. A lot. For the record, they weren't quite as popular when I started coming here a few years ago. But even though everyone and their fifth cousin twice removed seems to love (and populate) this place, it's still a good establishment. Good enough that I will recommend it to any and every (non-vegetarian friend) traveling through LA. And that, if I'm craving Wurstkuche badly enough, I will drive up from Orange County on a Friday night, in traffic, for two hours, to wait thirty plus minutes in line, to eat/drink here. It's pretty damn good. It's also one of the few things I miss about LA.They have a lot of exotic/interesting looking sausages, but I tend to always get the Kielbasa. It's a good size, very flavorful, and super juicy. Perfect with sauerkraut, sweet peppers, and stone ground mustard. Another standout sausage is the Louisiana Hot Link. Some sausages are better than others, although I've never encountered anyone who didn't enjoy their sausage at least somewhat, whatever they chose to get.They have absolutely delicious fries, which I always get with white truffle oil (an extra charge). Worth it. I also always get the Chipotle Mayo as my dipping sauce (and hope that whoever I'm sharing my fries with will get the Bleu Cheese, Walnut and Bacon dipping sauce). They have a lot of sauce options; some are better than others.Their condiments are top notch as well. Grilled onions and sweet peppers are always perfectly grilled. Sauerkraut is the correct tanginess with just the right amount of moisture. Hot peppers are sufficiently hot. And the selection of mustards is plentiful (although I always gravitate towards the stone ground - it's just better).And you can't forget the drinks. They have a lot of interesting imported drinks, but the only thing you really need to know is they have a TON of German beer on tap. I usually rotate between my three favorite, but you can't really go wrong with German beer.I've always been able to find (free) parking, which is super unusual in LA. The atmosphere is awesome. Service friendly and prompt. The food is worth the wait. Although it might be a more conventional dining experience if you stop in early/at a slow moment, I think the crowd/busyness of the restaurant is part of its charm. Eating dinner alongside other groups of happy friends is surprisingly fun/social. Go figure. So whenever I go I just plan to be there for a while. And, after that while, I always leave happy and satisfied. :)Finally, to VEGETARIANS, NON-BEEF/PORK EATERS, and PEOPLE WHO KEEP KOSHER: you might be interested to know that there ARE non-beef/pork sausages (chicken with funky flavors, mainly)... but ALL of the casings are beef or pork and NONE of the sausages are vegetarian/kosher."},{"date":"2011-06-02","rating":"5.0","review":"I've only been to Wurstkuche once, and it was love at first site.I got the duck, bacon and jalapeno sausage at my friend's recommendation and it was extremely tasty. We also got the Belgian fries which were just as delicious as they were fattening. They have a large assortment of dipping sauces out of which I would recommend the curry ketchup, pesto mayo and chipotle aioli. They also have a large selection of beers, which go great with their sausages in true German fashion. The seating area is reminiscent of a mess hall or dining hall and it's a great environment for a casual date or to kick back with a group of friends."},{"date":"2011-01-24","rating":"4.0","review":"I like your weiners, Wurstkuche, I like your weiners. I've been here plenty of times. It's a great place to hang out with your friends, grab a dog & fries and a tasty beer. It's a bit crowded at times, but nothing where it would turn me away from eating there.

I honestly wasn't impressed. The wait to get in took forever (our party of 6 waited outside 45+ minutes) and then once we ordered, it took another 20 minutes to snag a table. The vibe is very young and hip. Definitely the hipster scene.I enjoyed the beer though. I ordered the Franciskaner, which was light yet had a kick to it. I got the chicken and apple sausage (I know, boring) with peppers and onions, knowing that friends had warned me against the gamey duck or rabbit available. I also got a large order of their belgian fries to share with a friend with the chipotle aioli and I can't remember the other one. Overall, the food was okay. Nothing spectacular, and nothing that I'll pay $17 for again.My friend and I shared the apple pie ice cream sandwich, which was delicious! I couldn't get enough of it, even after the meal! That's the one thing I really enjoyed here.Overall, it was worth trying, but nothing I'd write home about.

It's probably because the food just rules that hard. I've had most of the sausages on the menu and have never been let down. I'll refrain from saying this one was better then that one because they are all good. The beer and random soda menu is also just crazy good. Only complaint is the ultra hipster vibe and laptop DJ vibe on the dining room. The truffle fries are the reason I continue to go, so crisp and full of flavor. Dipping sauces galore only add to that experience.  My favorite moment there was watching a bunch of painters POUNDING super strong beer the size of a fucking work boot as my mom and I ate and drank pints of Pabst. Best fries I have had here in the LA area...best sausages too."},{"date":"2011-07-24","rating":"4.0","review":"ITS FANCY TOP DOG (in Berkeley). I SWEAR. Okay, except for the fact that Wurstkuche has alcohol and fries and is a little bit more 'classier'. I think it might be because of the bread and the way they cook their hot dogs. Anyways, if I'm ever craving Top Dog and want to pay twice as much for it, I know where to go to get it now. It's definitely a fun experience to come here for a quick, casual lunch or even a late dinner run. Don't be fooled by the long line that goes out the door though. You make your order at the door, and food comes out fairly quickly. They have this whole food service thing down (I curse you M&M donuts! JK. But seriously, the wait there is unreasonably long).LOCATION/PARKING: It's near Little Tokyo. I thought this place would be hole-in-the-wall, surrounded by a bunch of other shops and restaurants, but it isn't. There are only a few other businesses located here. Parking is fairly easy because there's a LOT of street parking. FOOD/DRINKS: I always get the Floris Apple Ale, but the Fruili is also really good. Yummm! :D So, okay, if you're here, order the house's special, which in this case are exotic sausages. Of the exotics, I've tried the Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned with White Wine with Caramelized Onions and Sauerkraut, and Rattle Snake & Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers with Caramelized Onions and Sweet Peppers. YUMMM! (Note: All sausages are served with caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers or spicy peppers.) Honestly, the hot dogs didn't taste any different. It just tasted like a really well seasoned beef, pork, or chicken sausage. My favorite, Bockwurst (Veal, Pork, & Spices), here is also really good. The double dipped Belgian Fries are worth the hype! The dips however are mediocre (I tried the Chipotle Aioli, Curry Ketchup, Sundried Tomato Mayo, and Pesto Mayo).If hot dogs were human, Top Dog would be king and Wurstküche would be queen. This place is 'as good as it gets' in the world of hot dogs, and the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I'm not the biggest hot dog fan. I highly recommend people to try this place."},{"date":"2008-12-29","rating":"4.0","review":"As I type, I find myself within the 4 walls of 'wurstekuche''. It is definetly in a neighboorhood I would not look for food, wasn't it for Yelp.They're not even open for 6 weeks and 50+ reviews allready under their belt, and  Hot on Yelp. This place is the real deal, or it is just a hype, we'll see in a couple of months whatsup.There are a variety of reasons why I have to try the 'sausagekitchen', first of all; I am part German and I want to see if they can match my expectation with the experience I have. Reason numero 2; growing up in Holland (which is next to Belgium) makes me kind of a fries expert.The Bockwurst is great with caramelized onions and lots of spicy brown mustard. The buffalo, beef & pork w/chipotle peppers is allright in my opinion, but both my kids loved it. My wife did not 'Dig It', but the bratwurst was good according to my wife, she did not leave me a piece to try. So I have to come back soon to try it out for myself. It is a trendy establishment, the food is served in red metal plates, they serve soda's I have never hear of; Manhattan Special, Reeds, Moxie and Fentimans are some to name. There is still some work going on in the back, a bar where you also can enjoy your food. Eventually I believe it is more going to become a bar where you can eat instead of the Kitchen were you can drink.Last but not least, the fries they are Off The Hook, in Amsterdam there is a place called 'Manneke Pis' and that's how my fries tasted, like home sweet home. The only thing is to find a good sauce with it, Curry Ketchup is great, I'ld stay away from the Thai Peanut.They are kinda pricy....$45.44 for 2 adults and 2 kids, but it was worth it.

As you may know, the bf and I yelp literally EVERYTHING so after a lazy afternoon of sitting on the couch, both of us scrolling aimlessly on our iPhones, I came across a unique little sausage joint/gastropub that totally missed our radar. We had been cruising around the Arts District that past week trying to check out Blue Dahlia Cafe so I convinced him to give Wurstkuche place a try while also scouting out to see if Blue Dahlia was open.From its humble striped entrance, to its cucumber-infused water, to its great selection of drinks, beer, and mustard, Wurstkuche is THE place. We'll find ourselves coming here even AFTER dinner just to grab a snack. If you're a lover of french fries, you have to check this place out. Recommendations:- Mr Q. Cucumber Soda- Original Brat- Rattlesnake & Rabbit- Mango Chicken & Turkey- KleinAnd while, I'm semi-vegetarian, I don't recommend their veggie sausage.

Ok, lemme just say, everything that I've encountered that's Belgium (so far: waffles, fries, people) has been ridiculously enjoyable. The fries were dbl-fried and lightly salted and fluffy on the inside. Wonderful, I say!Some people can hate on the place for being really modern and hipster with its fancy order-numbers and minimalist kitchenware, but I kinda dug it. I don't know why I did, though, since I usually hate on places like that.

In fact, there are so many hipsters here that the restaurant walls cannot contain all of them. Hipsters runneth over. There are long lines stretching down the sidewalk and many of them order carry-out. It's a scene that I'm totally fine with, but if you're walking into it cold, it's a little bizarre. Standing in long lines for sausage also feels bizarre. But having been to Hot Doug's, in my native Chicago, I get it.The decor and the clientele aside, the sausages are very good. The Mango Jalepeno is hotter than other reviewers have claimed, but it's still tolerable. If you are a lightweight, as I am, you will feel it. I felt a real kick to the Duck & Bacon as well.The best part about Wurstkuche are the fries. My small order (klein) of Belgian fries were amazing, and the accompanying dipping sauce (blue cheese walnut and bacon) was even better. Speaking of the fries, I suspect that the fries are served in generous portions to compensate for the fact that the sausages are rather small.Overall, I really like having lunch here.

It is an absolute staple of the design world and hipsters alike. Fantastic food and a good vibe with a dash of indie culture.I've never been when there wasn't a line. The place is popular but for good reason. They are limited in that they only serve sausage, fries and beer, but the originality and selection of these three items would impress even the most experienced foodie. The flavor combinations in their Belgian sausages are ingenious (Rattlesnake and Rabbit anyone?) and the beers are exotic and fun.I recommend the Rabbit, Veal and Pork Seasoned with White Wine and the Belgian Fries with Truffle Oil. You won't be disappointed! The dipping sauces for the fries are out of this world. Chipotle Aioli and Pesto Mayo are my favorites by far and my beer of choice is the Apple Ale which is sweet but tasty (and a tad girly).The line moves fast, the employees are super friendly and everyone always seems happy to be there.

If this place had really good kraut, it would be hard to beat on any level.   I think they should at least have some kraut options, as they have many topping, dipping sauce and mustard options.   It wouldn't cost them that much more to make amazing kraut.  Just a little know how.   You really need to go to an authentic German or Bavarian restaurant to get great kraut.  Wurstkuche is not an authentic old world place.  It's very young and hipster, and though you would think their mainstay is quality and variety of exotic sausages, they really make their money on quantity- they serve thousands of sausages every day on a tiny little grill.  Which is great.  I love this place, and I want them to to well.   But don't expect the ma& pa homecooked flavor here.   The food is being mass produced (on a local level) Now, the french fries- I would place high among the \"best ever\" running. The dipping sauces they have are creative, complex and just right on the money.  I love it when places don't rely on ketchup and mustard as their staple condiments.  Wurstkuche isn't afraid to make bold moves, and if you go there at anytime, you'll see by the fast moving, always constant long line, that it's paying off for them in spades.  Also... great beer selection and 2.50 PBR on tap.  This is very rare in Los Angeles.  Fantastic beer, good sausages, great fries, huge variety, good people, new age artistic ambiance...

It was really juicy. But honestly my favorite thing I had was the fries (but I just love fries in general. Hah.). I liked the dipping sauces we had but I could eat the fries by itself. I would compare Wurstkuche to Hot Dougs in Chicago, with an LA, hipster vibe complete with a DJ and communal seating."},{"date":"2013-05-20","rating":"3.0","review":"In the center of the Arts District you'll find this sausage house.

This place was recommended to me by locals in the know and I cant tell you how glad I was I listened!Walking up to the place there was a nice line but, an employee was handing out menus and took beer orders so we were informed and were happy as we waited to order. Essentially this is a hot dog joint but, not your ordinary boring hot dog think of what a German Emeril Lagasse gourmet sausage on a bun concept for LA would do if he was drunk on the best Bavarian beer!So after downing a beer in line I ordered 2 different items off the menu for my main course and then saw that they offer truffle glaze on their fries. HOLD THE PHONE truffle glaze? I died and woke up in foodie heaven!After I ordered I wandered down a dark hallway to the back dining room. Very cool spot with DJ decks (for what I assume is for the night shift), long tables to sit at and a nice bar in the back of the room. The room was pleasant and everyone seemed to be having fun.My food came after a bit (I guess they are busy all the time so its a little wait but not ridiculous) and was served with ketchup and 5 different mustard options. This is how I knew they were serious, I mean 5 types of mustard really says you arent playing around!  The sausages were great and really hit the spot but, what I think really made my day was the truffle glazed fries with 2 different dipping sauces.

The sausages I have tried often have the right amount of spices. The staff often recommends a good beer to pair with your specific order of sausage.This place is trending right now so be ready to wait in line... outside. This place has no real waiting room and they don't take names on a list. You get there, you see the line, you wait in it. Be ready to order because at the end of the line, is the cashier. You have to know what you want before you get there or else you waited in line for nothing. Usually, you can walk up to the front of the line and contact a host who will gladly help you with getting a menu you can read while in line. Don't worry, they're not big menus so its not inconvenient to hold while in line (paper menus).One thing I don't know is if you want more food, you have get back in the long line again. I have had enough with the food I ordered the first time so I have not needed to order seconds. They don't have normal waiters/waitresses. Only delivery to your table.Four things I don't like about this place:1) There is not enough seating for the amount of people they have. It's worth waiting for a seat though.2) The DJ is too loud. That's right, there is a DJ playing during dinner hours. No, there is no dance floor. 3) There is no parking for this place. You have to park out on the street. There is a parking lot across the street, but you have to pay approximately $3 for parking.4) Their security guards... Don't shake their hands or let them touch you. I walked into the restroom my first time there. A security guard was doing his business. As I walked in, he finished and walked right out of the restroom. That's right, he didn't bother to wash his hands. I hope they don't let them in or around the kitchen.Recommendation:A must try if you love to try different types of sausages and if you like beer. Their beer selection is good, a lot of dark beers.

The thing that killed it for me was the long wait... For sausages. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but I felt like I was standing in line for a club with music bumping from the inside as we stood outside shivering and waiting. I was ready to pull out my i.d. for a bouncer. Instead we were greeted by a guy who took our drink order once we finally got inside. Thank goodness... because I didn't know how much longer my growling stomach could wait and a quick drink was the pick me up I needed after the wait. I wasn't into the communal tables though. It was either a choice of that or way too tiny coffin shaped tables... Not ideal if you have more than 2 people in your group and don't want to sit at the communal tables.The food itself was decent. I split the rattlesnake & rabbit, duck & bacon, and the vegetarian Mexican chipotle sausage. The rattlesnake was well seasoned and had a good texture. I would have never known I was eating snake. The duck and bacon was as rich as it sounded, and the chipotle sausage was flavorful and spicy. The fries were delicious too, but it was the sauces that made it. Make sure your friends order their fries with different sauces so you get a chance to try a variety.Overall, I enjoyed the food, but I'm not sure if it was worth the wait.

Supposedly an amber ale but it was defintiely stronger in alcohol content and a little bit more fruity than the typical amber ale...After you have begun drinking, you go on to selecting your sausage.. I had the Buffalo, beef & pork with Chipotle peppers topped with carmelized onions and spicy peppers which was hella bomb.. Juicy but a little bit crisp the way hot dogs should taste.. WAY better than dirty dogs.. Make sure to get the belgian fries with the truffle oil.. Thicker fries yet still tender and a little crispy.

The wait was a bit much for glorified hot dogs.Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno peppers - Mine was more on the salty side, but buttery. My friend & fellow yelper (Julia L.) also ordered the same thing. Though hers was less salty, it was surprisingly dry. But in reality, I could not distinguish the meat from other hot dogs I've had, and just thought of it as a spicy hot dog.KIELBASA - which wasn't anything special, but my thought was u can't go wrong. I was right. It wasn't bad. It had a nice flavor and wasn't dry.The fries were the best part of the meal. Super crispy to munch on. Liked the sauce I picked (pesto mayo). Had a slight cucumber taste to it. Was quite cooling and refreshing. The other sauces weren't impressive at all. In the end, even the small portion of fries was too much for me to handle. It hurt trying to finish. Yes, THIS FAT KID couldn't finish his fries.What my friends ordered:Rabbit, Veal, and Pork - very juicy and had a very good all aroundflavor. My favorite of the ones I've tried.The Mango Jalapeno - very fruity.Filipino Maharlika - I really liked the Asian twist. Kinda takes me back to Asian food.Duck & Bacon - Where's the duck? It certainly did not taste like duck.Overall, this place is over-hyped. This Fat Kid wasn't all too impressed or satisfied. I expected way more considering the extensive line and wait. The food coma you get afterwards isn't one of those happy ones. I think the only thing I enjoyed is having the great company of my foodie buddies. Should you try? Eh, I changed my mind from yes to maybe. Will I come back. That is a good question. I actually prefer bacon dogs or \"ghetto dogs\" over this place. I think it's even more worth it to go to The Alibi Room in Culver City for the Kogi Tacos.

The service however was a bit slow ( I am sure because they are working out the kinks) but overall the entire experience was very cool. I ordered the safe bratwurst topped with kraut, sweet peppers and caramelized onions. Since I am a huge fan of condiments, they had a plethora of mustards for me to pick- dijon, honey, whole grain, brown spicy. It was heaven.   I thought I would save the rattlesnake and rabbit sausages for next time. Gotta start with the basics, right?The actual brat was very good. The bun was substantial but not overly hard or crusty, the toppings were very generous and the brat had wonderful flavors bursting out. Wash it all down with your favorite German or Belgian beer and you are good to go. The fries were awesome too. They come in little brown bags similar to pomme frites in NYC, and they have tons of sauces. We tried the Chipolte Aioli recommended by the cashier and it was damn tasty. Thick cut fries, double fried... damn, you can't get any better than this! Here is a tip to all the single ladies---- COME HERE.

Both excellent choices, though if you go with a party (and you should), collectively, you should try to hit as many of the sauces as possible.As mentioned elsewhere here, the sausage selection is vast and eclectic.  I've actually never tried any of the \"normal\" sausages, as I am usually having fun with the rattlesnake and rabbit, alligator and port, and the rabbit and veal sausages.  Seriously.  Beer selection is a fun, but I have not fallen in love with any of them in particular yet.  The Schwartzbier is good and and the Fruli is nice, but not as a strong a flavor as I would like.Get here early, especially on the weekend.  By the time 7pm hits, this place already has a line out the door and it only gets longer.  Parking is usually pretty tractable and can be found further down the street or around the corner (though again, get there early)."},{"date":"2012-01-25","rating":"5.0","review":"Hot Italian sausage + Fries + good beer = heaven!!! love the food there.

I ordered the exotic rattlesnake and rabbit w/fries and strawberry beer and my friend ordered the alligator sausage. We both enjoyed the food , but what I couldn't get over was how good their water was, it taste fresh and clean w/a cucumber taste. Whatever was in it kept me drinking more & more and I'm not even a water drinker."},{"date":"2013-08-02","rating":"4.0","review":"Pretty good sausage, pretty good beer selection.

Food:Bratwurst - most of the bratwurst I have has been pure veal, but theirs is a mixture of veal pork and something else. Not the best bratwurst I've had, but since bratwurst is hard to come by, this place gets props as does this wuerstSpicy Louisana - spicy is goooddd but if you can't handle spicy stay away from this hot stuff!!! RattleSnake/Rabbit - if you have never had rattlesnake before, snake, like lamb, has a very distinctive and strong smell. If you are smell sensitive, I would not order the rattlesnake. Also, if you dislike strong spices, I would also stay away from the rattlesnake. They use a lot of spices on this so it's very flavorful. The meat is very dense and chewy, and actually goes really well with dijon mustard. It's worth trying once for the culinary curious individuals, but I don't think I will get it again. All wieners come nestled tucked nicely between thick warm buns and is topped with your choice of grilled pepper, grilled onions, sauerkraut, and I forget what else. Unless you have a really hearty appetite, one order of wuerst and a klein order of fries should leave you not over stuffed, but content. Fries -These are seasoned batter fries which come with a side of dipping sauce. Klein comes with one dipping sauce Groot comes with two dipping sauces. You need to order a side of fries and try out their sauces: Tzatziki sauce-  nice yogurt sauce to balance out the seasoning. Chipotle ketchup- just spicy ketchup for those who love to spice up their life. Chipotle mayo- liked the ketchup better. Pesto, good, but like the tzatziki better, and many more!Water is cucumber infused water. If you like me hate cucumber, go to the bar in the back and ask for a glass of normal water. In the alternative, try any of their extensive offering of beer!!!Street parking so keep your fingers crossed!

Wurstkuche specializes in innovative sausage combinations like, Rattle Snake & Rabbit with Jalapeno.

I had the Buffalo, Pork, Beef and Chipotle sausage with caramelized onions, spicy peppers and sweet-hot mustard. The sausage was very flavorful and the skin was perfectly crispy. I also ordered a side of their fresh French fries (which are very thick), and you have 10+ dipping sauces to choose from in which to drown your potato friends . And what to wash it all down with? Why not one of the 20+ Belgian and German beers that are on tap. Also, $2 PBR pints (holler) if you're looking to save the scrilla.Now that you get the overall picture, let me just say that Wurstkuche is head and shoulders above any \"hot dog\" and \"beer\" joint that I know of and is a great addition to the rather lackluster downtown eating scene."},{"date":"2014-06-08","rating":"3.0","review":"It's good!"},{"date":"2014-07-11","rating":"4.0","review":"Cant beat it.

Today was my second visit, and the line was much shorter; I think a short wait here is fine, because it gives you a chance to peruse their diverse and unusual offerings. The sausages vary from run of the mill (Louisiana hot link) to exotic (rattlesnake sausage, anyone? rabbit?),  The fries are delicious and there's a great variety of dipping sauces to choose from (my favorite is the chipotle aioli).  They have an array of unique sodas and a good (but pricey) beer list.My biggest beef (no pun intended) is that you order in one room and go sit and wait for your food in another.  You wait in line (I LOVE LOVE LOVE that they have someone taking drink orders and serving you your beverage of choice while you're waiting in line), finally make a choice, you are drooling and your stomach is growling just from reading the menu; you happily place your order and take your number, super excited to be able to sit and enjoy your beer while wating for your food...And then you go into the dining room...And discover it's packed; there's nowhere to sit.  You have to hover and prowl like an old lady in a parking lot on Black Friday.  I wish wish wish they would just have a \"to go\" counter in the front and have full blown table service in the back.  If I place a food order I'd like to know I'm going to have a place to sit and enjoy that food, or ideally ALREADY be sitting when I place the order.  They already run the food out to the dining room; I don't see why they couldn't go the extra step and have people take the orders in there too.Meanwhile, I highly recommend ordering your food to go and walking over to Angel City Brewing and enjoying it with one of their $5 drafts."},{"date":"2013-06-07","rating":"5.0","review":"Good beer selection, tasty food, trendy/hipster ambiance."},{"date":"2011-05-23","rating":"5.0","review":"Dear Wustkuche,I miss you dearly, I hope we can spend good times together again.

We heard about this place from word of mouth... decided to give it a try since there was barely anyone in there (wasn't going to take long in other words) and the fact that we rarely get out of the house these days (baby). Our son is asleep... and we decided that I should stay in the car with him (car is on with AC btw) while my wife goes in and orders take out. Just so happens while shes waiting for our order our son wakes up the way babies USUALLY wake up and cries. Now while I am trying to calm him down... I am looking for his bottle/toys... no luck. We are literally parked outside the front door so I text my wife to come back and help me find his bottle.This is where Wurstkuche comes into play. Apparently while this was happening some busboy/waiter that's hanging outside their establishment during break decides to speak up and call my wife, as shes walking back to the car (due to my text), a bad mother for \"Leaving her child in a car\"... failing to realize or even look to see that I was in the car with him or that the car was on (its a Prius so its quiet maybe he thought it was off)... regardless, he failed a basic awareness check and just decided to open his dumb mouth... spouting off hate to paying customers. We chose to ignore this guy because we didn't want to escalate anything with someone who wasn't really worth our time. Once he finally realizes that I was in the car to begin with... he just walks back in through the double black door service entrance, without dismissing what he said earlier or even an apology... lol what a low class scumbag. So my wife and I switch places and I go in and get our order while she waits with our son (he's happy now btw). I get our food within a few mins and leave... kinda po'd.Anyways, I actually liked the food but this experience ruined our meal. I will not be returning to this location while this low life works there (Hispanic mid 20's maybe early 30's, shaved head... rides bike to work maybe, dunno he was hanging around the bike rack out front). Maybe management should do something about him before he makes a bad name for their establishment... just sayin..."},{"date":"2011-04-10","rating":"4.0","review":"I think everything to say about this place has been said, so I'm just adding more. I had the buffalo/beef/pork sausage with onions/sweet peppers and the Austin Blues with onions/spicy peppers and damn they were good! I was honestly expecting this place to be overhyped but I was impressed with the flavors in each sausage. The meat/peppers/onions/ketchup went so damn well with each other, so many delicious flavors in every bite! The only thing I didn't like was the the bun is oversized for the sausage. It helps to keep the toppings on the sausage, but that's it. The beer selection is all import with a few American beers and PBR on draft. I got a Franziskaner, which was damn good, so I'll definitely check out the rest of the lineup next time. They also have some craft bottle sodas which I'll try for sure. Price wise, I think it is a little overkill. $30 for 2 sausages, fries, and a beer. I could've gone for another sausage but I didn't want to wait in line again. But $6-$7 for each sausage is a little much, but I sure as hell don't know any place else that serves up sausages like this.  So the line... I came here on a Sunday when CycLAvia was going on so there were a bunch of bikes locked up all around the side walk. Wait wise, it was about 20 minutes and another 5-10 for our food to come to our table. I liked that one of the guys was taking drink orders while waiting in the ordering line, so at least it wasn't a total bore. Once I ordered I went to the seating area and was surprised that the place wasn't very packed considering how long the line was. They should find a way to speed it up the ordering a bit to shorten up the line, but not have a bunch of people scavenging for a place to sit.Oh yeah, cafeteria style seating. I didn't mind it really since I was able to snatch up a table against the wall but there are 3 bench tables in the middle of the eating area with some tables along the walls and another booth area in the corner adjacent to where the turntables are set up. It didn't bother me much but I noticed larger groups had to try to configure themselves so they could sit with each other since you pretty much have to share elbow room if you sit on the bench tables. There is also a patio area with 5-6 tables as well. Parking, stick to the street. There are a few sections of metered parking but there are plenty of free spots if you don't mind a 2-3 minute walk.Overall, cool spot and will definitely be coming back.The fact that this place is right in between Little Tokyo and the Art's district is pretty cool. The Art's side has plenty of graffiti all over the place.

NOTE: We both hate anything remotely spicy. This was not spicy, it was delicious and moist both in their own way, while the duck was meaty, it wasn't overbearing in anyway. The rattlesnake and rabbit was tender and succulent. [Oh man did I just have an foodgasm there?]. We felt so adventurous that we even put carmelized onions on mine and on his peppers. [It isnt our style trust me.] No mustard needed for this. We knew this was good on its own.As for the Belgian fries, well aside from getting the large with 2 dipping sides (chipotle aioli --had a kick-- and the subtle buttermilk ranch), they were on the overly sea salted side and they were cold upon arrival. sad.

I suggest you come here and try their LITER of beer!! Come early though because it fills up quick! By the time we went around the block to find parking the line was out the door."},{"date":"2011-11-04","rating":"4.0","review":"Day: SaturdayTime: 9 pmWhen I walked in I was put-off by the long line but the greeter was walking around taking beer orders. He helped me select a beer (based on alcohol content to $ and taste ratio) and I received the beer quickly. While sipping the beer, I looked at menu and decided on the Alligator & Pork sausage with carmellized onions and spicy peppers on the side.We went to the dining area of the restaurant (much larger than the ordering area) and sat down at the communal picnic style tables. There was also a bar and a stage for musicians in this areal.Food arrived and the sausage was tasty and the fries were delicious. They were thick cut but crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It's hard for me to judge sausages but this was one of the better ones I have had. A large order of fries is definietely enough to split between 2 people (we split it between the 3 of us)."},{"date":"2011-07-26","rating":"5.0","review":"Beer and brats! I love this place. Been here once and fell in love with it. When it comes to exotic sausages, this is as exotic as it gets. I ordered the sausage with rattlesnake, rabbit and jalapeno peppers, with a side of Belgian fries and a beer that I do not know how to pronounce. It tasted good though, that is more important. Back to the sausage though. It was hearty, flavorful, and once you get over the fact that you are eating a snake and a rabbit, in sausage link form, it is quite an enjoyable experience. It actually does taste a little like chicken. You order your food and it is brought to you. The  tables are cafeteria style, tables and wooden benches. I suppose that add to the uniqueness of the restaurant, which reminded me of junior high. The atmosphere is dim and pleasantly raucous. I recommend trying to get there earlier in the evening, probably before 6pm so you do not have to wait in line for so long.

It's fantastic. Be patient and alert when waiting for a table. Also, most people are super kind so don't be afraid to ask if you can share a spot.While he is very cute and kind, the DJ will not play any song that is too \"clubby\" so don't event think about asking him to play Rihanna's new track. Apparently management will make him change it. I just want to dance while I eat my gourmet sausage thank you.They have an amazing beer selection, I recommend them all. Also food, yes, the food. I always get the Maharlika Filipino Sausage... no, not cause I'm Filipino, but cause it's moist and has great flavor... some of the sausages are really dry so I'd ask the staff which ones those are and stay away.I love this place.

But look slightly further and walk through a skinny corridor and voila, you've got a cozy seating area with a bar where you can wash your weiners and fries down with an ice cold brew. This place has some really unique hot dogs(alligator, jackrabbit, and rattlesnake among others), but they have all the tried and true dogs too, like louisiana hot link, bratwurst, and even chicken apple and spice. I wasn't really in the mood to try new things, so I went with the chile/cilantro dog and chicken apple spice dog (my friends gave me crap for being a yelper and not trying the weird stuff, so next time I'm here I guess I gotta suck it up) and the regular fries. You can get them in a more expensive oil, and though it is tastier, honestly I don't think it's worth it. For my 2 dogs, fries, and franziskaner hef beer, I dropped a whopping $24. It was good, but kind of on the pricey side. Plus seating sucked, but that was sort of our fault, can't blame the establishment really for being busy when we arrived late.Interesting place to eat, definitely try to have your whole group there earlier if you want to sit/eat together."},{"date":"2011-07-26","rating":"5.0","review":"Now, there are only a few places I will try gourmet sausages.

The beer selection is unparalleled in Rhineland authenticity and quality. I felt like I was back in Chicago's Andersonville with all the German and Belgian brews imported in.3. A sausage haven with dimly-lit picnic table seating and a DJ was unexpected, yet had me vibing the whole time. Think 4th grade cafeteria with cucumber water and sveeral different bottles of mustard around you.4. The Belgian frites were saucesome. I mean that literally... They had several different dipping sauces. $2 for truffle oil is unneccesary but bomb.5. The gourmet sausages were amazia. No diggity, no doubt. The duck and bacon sausage was a match made in heaven.

There was a pretty long line when I showed up, but it was worth it. Just be prepared to wait, cause it was pretty late when we got there. The area it's in is a tad sketchy at night, but it is downtown Los Angeles after all. There's bench seating both inside and out, sort of like a cafeteria--i guess it's sort of an oktoberfest theme. I do remember it being a bit too loud inside so we moved outside. But definitely the hot dog place of Los Angeles.

Except the name. The owner is a good friend of mine, and it was so interesting watching him put so much love into this restaurant. He made sure that every detail was perfect. From trying 500 sausages to choosing the perfect 20, from the awesome chairs to the matching plates for the sausages, his attention to detail comes through and is totally the reason the restaurant is so successful! It's a great, simple idea executed perfectly. My favorite is the chicken-apricot sausage, because it satisfies my craving for sweet...then I can avoid being the fatty who wants dessert after a sausage, fries, and beer. It's such a good place for big groups - you can also make a reservation for like 30, making it ideal for work parties, birthday parties etc. The line is out the door and around the block most of the time (luckily, they're opening a westside joint soon), so be prepared to wait. Once you get settled in with your sausage and beer, you'll be totally happy and it's worth the wait. The name is frustrating because after a million times hearing it, I still can't say it correctly!

There are individual tables, but hard to find.-The self-serve water tastes like chemicals. LA tap water isn't very drinkable I guess....-They only have one bun option, which I personally don't mind.-The unidentifiable mustard bottles in the seating area are not the cleanest because everyone's using them with their Wurstkuche-ified hands. I would use a napkin if you're a hygienic freak like me.I have yet to try the other varieties of sausages that they offer, but I do know that their Austin Blues is pretty delish! The filling is pretty chunky and flavorful. I love that the casing has the perfect *snap* to it. The roll is perfectly soft and not dried out nor stale, as it can be at other places. I got mine with just grilled onions which was perfect. I'm not brave enough to try any of the daring ones like Rattlesnake and Rabbit etc. especially after a friend tried one of them and described it as gamey. Bleh.They also have a wide selection of beers, including Allagash White, one of my favorite whites! That made me extra happy.And, their fries aren't out of this world, but pretty delicious and actually much better than Pommes Frites in New York where they actually specialize in fries.More than the food though, I just love the atmosphere; it's a nice place to chill and carry fun conversations."},{"date":"2011-07-07","rating":"4.0","review":"This place is pretty amazing.  Unfortunately, everyone knows it!  If you head into it expecting to wait in line at least half an hour, you will have a much better time.  Just make sure you have some good company.I will admit I have not gotten too adventurous with my orders, but I have loved what I tried.  The sundried tomato and mozzerella was pretty good, but I actually like the chicken apple and spices even better.  Get it with the sweet peppers and carmelized onions.  the fries are really filling.  We got the chipotle aioli (amazing!) and the curry ketchup (okay, but a little weird).  The beers are great too.  While it would be a mistake to skip the great selection of German and Belgian beers, I did notice they have PBR for only $2.50.  Seating is super crowded and loud, so make sure you have someone scope out a spot while others are in line, and expect to do a lot of shouting.  A really fun experience still though."},{"date":"2013-01-22","rating":"2.0","review":"Came here for a class pre-midterm hangout.  I have to say, it was way too hyped up.  The Rattlesnake dish tasted exactly like any other pork dish.  Ambiance is nice but not much else after that."},{"date":"2011-01-11","rating":"5.0","review":"I used to live a block or so from here, and I loved coming here for food and drinks.I did try the rattlesnake and rabbit, but to be honest I preferred the normal bratwurst, but I always got the grilled onions and sauerkraut for toppings.

The Buffalo was good too, just not as buttery and rich and the R&R.The second time I got the Filipino Marharlika, not bad, not bad. Sweet but not cloyingly sweet, reminded me of Chinese sausage. The real star was the fries though. They're Belgian style and both times I got them with the truffle oil glaze. Just do it, it's definitely worth the extra pocket change and the earthiness goes perfectly with the twice cooked fries. Those things are amazing by themselves, no dipping sauce needed...but the chipotle aioli and pesto aioli are great compliments.

It's a little hidden, around the corner from a poppin bar but you'll spot it as soon as you see the line out the door. As long as the line is, it moves relatively quickly and the staff there entertain you along the way as if you were waiting for the Peter Pan ride at Disneyland.The waitertainer recommended an apple-strawberry concoction while I waited, and I sucked this baby down like candy. It was so light and fruity that it didn't even taste like beer! - Not for the hardcore beer drinkers, but yay to the cocktail-type peeps!We ordered the Filipino sausage and the Rattlesnake one. Both were delicious, and \"gourmet\" tasting. Honestly with the amount of peppers and toppings on there (yum!), I couldn't tell the difference between the two (except for the Jalapeno spice that jumped out of the rattlesnake). Texture was right on. Skin casing was not too thick, too thing - held the meat together. Slight sweetness on the Filipino; spicy attack on the Rattlesnake. All their toppings - spicy, sweet peppers; sauerkraut; caramelized onions were a delight. They're solid sausages and you'd be happy.Fries? Thicker, soggy yet delightful. The many dipping sauces make it fun. I'm a curry ketchup fan but I like curry on the usu.The atmosphere is loud and busy - perfect for a fun night with a ton of friends, but bring your megaphone if you expect to hear/have a conversation!

Like for serious, I wanted to hate this place so bad. Located in the shittier part of downtown (and I mean scary, not because of all the douchey hipsters), insane 40 min or longer line waiting to just ORDER your food, pretentious menu, beers I've never heard of... and for some god forsaken reason I've still have yet to get my head around... I ended up actually LIKING EVERYTHING I wanted to hate about this place.Starting off with the area.. yes, it is pretty damn scary. But you know what? Scary keeps the DOUCHEY hipsters at bay. You know the ones. The people that want to be all \"urban\" but want to do it from the comfort of their own safe little bubble. Where mmaaayyybbbee going a street or two east of LaBrea is their idea of slumming it. It might've been just because we got there well after the sun had gone down the horizon, but the people in line with us at the time actually seemed like a pretty good bunch... talking about... music and movies? NOT about who they saw at so and so place and how it was UNCONCEIVABLE that they got a better table than they did?Which is another thing... the time it takes to actually make it to the front of the counter to order... well it opens up time for you to get to know your neighbors a bit (not that I did cos I was sort of sobering up and junk. But if I were in a better state of mind... like I said the people seemed cooler than the normal bunch I run into at these \"must try\" places...) I can imagine that you can ask about what people are gonna order, and irregardless of whether someone has been there or not, I have heard bits of conversations going on, and it seemed that everyone had things thrown at them about what they should get.\"Zomg, you NEED to try the duck wiener\"\"Nah man, GATOR sounds awesome!\"\"Pfft screw you guys, I think my hero Sam Jackson would want to try the motha fuckin rattlesnake yo!\"But anyway, when you get sort of close-ish to the entrance... there are actually staff going around taking drink orders. And just in the nick of time too, cos 40 minutes is just enough to if you show up drunk, that you start to get into that ragey I'mma killa some people if I dont get a drink sober state (which note to self: next time bring a flask rubbing alcohol or some other strong drink cos you will need it). Anyway 40 min goes by, you get your beer, are satiated for a bit and you get to make your order! Which you know exactly what you want cos you've had plenty of time to decide and have heard about all the cons and benefits of every fucking thing on the menu by then. LolAnyway after making your order you're given some number cone thing and sent off to go to the back area where you need to either have no moral compass or have the patience of fucking buddha himself in order to find yourself a seat. Lucky for us, some group we decided to park in front of were just finishing off their beers and let us take their spot. :o cool hipsters? Yup, they exist, and seemed like they like to migrate to wurstkuche.Anyway food came out after some odd minutes I can't recall cos damn, whatever beer I ordered was strong and got me happy again :D. I ordered the rattlesnake (of course, who's hero ISNT Sam Jackson?) whilst my companions had the duck and the gator.All I can say is, if Sam Jackson weren't so manly he probably would've tried some of the other junk on the menu and have found out that the rattlesnake isn't the best choice to go for. Shit tasted just like a chicken hot dog. Blerggghh.Lucky for me my buddies let me try some of their dogs and while the duck was pretty damn amazing. Fatty, flavorful, amazing... the gator actually beat the living tar out of it. All the texture, fat, (oh god I just realized how hipsterish or foodie I sound D:), but the spice! Zomg... that is what the duck was missing and that is what the gator delivered! Subtle at first and then BAM! Fuck you sir, I'm a goddamn gator! I guess if you don't like spicy, by all means the duck is GREAT. But it must be the all the hot latin blood not coursing through my veins that just makes me LOVE the spice!Ah, I guess I forgot to sort of mentionish the seating. Ever been to octoberfest? Where they just have like long benches of seats and everythings all communal? Well it's like that. Not a bad thing IMO. I like talking to my neighbors and being all nosy and junk usually. But for some, it may not be your thing.Also make sure to bring pencils so you can draw on the table cloth, some of the shit I saw was pretty damn hilarious! :DThey also had a DJ playing when I went there. I normally don't like that kind of music but with the vibe, the great food, and the STRONG ASS beer they serve there. All was right with the world.I would've given this place an OM NOM NOM NOM!! rating, but the wait REALLY is the thing holding me back.

I ordered the Chicken Apple & Spices, which was so tasty! It was a good blend of sweet and savory and the bun was soft and moister than your average, as they use freshly baked rolls. Delish. I also took a bite out of my friends' Mango Jalapeno and Louisiana Hot Link. The Mango Jalapeno was good, but less sweet and more piquant than Chicken Apple & Spices--between the two, I'd go with Chicken Apple & Spices. And the Hot Link was amazing and so flavorful! If you enjoy spicy foods, the Hot Link should be on your list of sausages to try.The fries were alright. They were like steak fries, which I'm not usually a fan of as I much prefer a crispier make like shoestring fries. The BBQ and Chipotle sauces were satisfying, but the Pesto Mayo was a no-no; it tasted like bland mayo with the slightest hint of pesto..bleh. I hear that their profound selection of beers must be reckoned with, and pretty much everyone orders what seems like a huge glass goblet of brew, so I plan on giving it a try the next time I'm there."},{"date":"2011-03-10","rating":"5.0","review":"Sausage and Beer, does it get any better than that?I mean really, the beer menu itself is ridiculous.

They serve genuine german sausages and the meat variety is insane. Come on, RATTLESNAKE?....REALLY? I honestly can't even really put this place into words, you just have to try it for yourselves.

Aside from the sweet ambiance, the interesting decor, and the music and great bar that takes up this place, the food hits my neverending desire to try foods that would make people raise their eyebrows at me for trying.The concept of this place is great. Order your food in the front, and then take your number to the back where you'll find a bar and lounge area that's almost hidden away down a one way secret corridor. Last time I came here my friend and I went all out. Rabbit and rattlesnake sausage for me, two orders of fries with truffle oil, curry ketchup and chipotle aioli sauce, and whatever my friend got (I really didn't care because of all the yumminess in front of ME). I've got to say that this place makes your exotic eating adventures very easy to do and extremely easy to enjoy. Loved every bit of it, especially the selection of taps they have here. If you ask the bartender, he can even pair a beer to whatever your eating. Well-trained? I think so.This perfect escapade into the unknown of my culinary adventures warrants 5 well deserved stars.

Oh you know, just had a rabbit and rattlesnake hot dog. No Big Deal. Wurstkuche, a place that has gained recognition and prominence in the downtown Los Angeles area due to the un-conventional hot dogs they serve. First off, this place is already good because there wasn't really that long of a line, in comparison to the over rated Pink's hot dogs(+1). Off to the menu. The hot dogs served here are conventional, and on the other side, just plain weird ingredients. What I mean by weird is they have rabbit and rattle snake hot dogs, bacon and duck, alligator and rabbit, ostrich and something.  You get to pick like two toppings for the hot dogs, such as onions or peppers, so that's pretty cool. So, basically just anything you usually don't see in regular hot dogs, you'll see it here.  The Belgian fries here are probably the best fries I had in my life. They're thick pieces of potato, fried in the most flavorful oil, and you get to pick two different sauces! Beers here are out of this world. All the beers are Belgian based or German based, so you know that's gonna be good.  All types of different ales, ipas, stouts, etc. are to be drunk at you discretion. :)The service is pretty good and fast. The staff is pretty nice if you don't know what beer to order. There's outdoor and indoor seating. Indoors is pretty cool because there's a DJ that spins all night as you eat, but not loud enough to piss you off  cause you can still have a convo. Inside, there's just a lot of picnic styled tables in a dark setting(diveish style vibe).I like it, and you should too."},{"date":"2014-05-19","rating":"4.0","review":"first time...wish me luck"},{"date":"2012-09-13","rating":"5.0","review":"Nothing like an exotic wiener!"},{"date":"2013-04-15","rating":"5.0","review":"The best.

I spent a few years in Berlin, so this was kind of a fun throwback for me. I liked their beer selection, although I do think it's quite pricey. Some go up to $11 for a beer. I tried the Smoked Apple, Potato Sausage with onions and sauerkraut. The sauerkraut was really authentic. The bun was pretty good, light and a little bit chewy. The sausage though, really didn't have much of a taste. Maybe the meat sausages are way tastier, but mine was just so-so. We also ordered the fries and those were pretty good, I liked all the dipping sauces. All in all, it's a nice place to relax, drink some beers and people watch (if you sit on the patio). The decor is really minimal and cool inside, and I liked the small unique touches that Wurstkuche had. If they could improve on anything it would be to add more flavor to their veggie dogs. I would go back to try different ones."},{"date":"2013-11-12","rating":"4.0","review":"Yummy sausages, home made, ree-dick fries and sauces.

I think they could use a better bun for the sausages, and I would of liked my fries with more crisp, but other than that, the food + experience was awesome. I got here at 7pm on a Thursday and didn't have to wait in any line, and had no problem finding a place to sit, but by the time we left around 8pm, the line outside was pretty crazy. This place has that understated NY feel to it, and since I'm obsessed with NY, Wurstküche gets brownie points for the cool vibe too!UPDATE: I came back here last week and I'm pretty sure they changed their bun (probably after numerous negative comments about it on reviews).

Couldn't find it for the life of me. However after waiting 2 lights on Alameda I believe with nobody making a left turn I got pissed, made a u-turn and then a right. Lo and behold I stumbled right on to it.Thursday afternoon about 4:00PM and the patio was already full. Found free parking (a Godsend in Downtown) about a block away and me and my bro checked it out. I must say the place was pretty jumping inside as well. Since we walked into the back we had to travel to the front to make an order. We both debated on getting the unique offerings, but settled on good old bratwurst and Belgium fries wih sauces  for our first visit and headed to the back with number in hand to wait for our order. I was driving so hadn't planned on drinking, but my bro the most potent beer on the menu (forgot the name). I later ordered some German lager for myself and while talking with a few other patrons realized that the large Stein of Pabst for $5 was a favorite.The food was good and bratwurst fresh with kraut on mine and peppers on my friend's. The fries, average and the walnut bleu cheese sauce, although sounding great never quite stayed on the fries from the dipping trip to our mouths.Trendy with unique custom metal bun servers and very West-Side IMO, but decent eats.

I HATE loud, echoey places with uncomfortable crowded seating. This place had exactly that vibe. And yet, I enjoyed it. It was Saturday prime dinner hour and the line was long, but it moved quickly and efficiently (tip: being already a little buzzed and going with good entertaining friends is very helpful). They take your drink order as soon as you get in the door, even if you are still waiting in line. This is a very good idea. They have a vast array of yummy artisan beers. I didn't see what I wanted and asked the server for a recommendation. He assessed my preferences and suggested something. He was spot on: my beer was delicious. I ordered the duck, bacon and jalapeno sausage. My husband ordered the vegetarian chipotle one, and we ordered a vegetarian Italian one to share - all topped with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. We got a large Belgian fry with sun dried tomato mayo and chipotle ketchup as dipping sauces. The \"in-line\" server came around to make sure we understood about the toppings and dipping sauces so we could keep things moving smoothly. I appreciate that. The food came out quickly after we seated ourselves in the loud, cavernous \"dining\" room. For my money ($42.50 to be exact, for the food and beer for two), everything was superb. The mustards at the table were all distinctly different and all the sausages were GREAT (I liked the duck one best - juicy, tender and oh so flavorful - cooked to perfection!). The fries were heavenly - thick, caramelized, crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. The sun dried tomato mayo was subtle and delicious. The chipotle ketchup was so-so. I could barely hear a word of conversation with my companions throughout the meal. I found the music to be dreadful.

They also have a what appears to be a pretty fantastic beer menu, although I don't drink so I wouldn't actually know. They have a very limited non-alcoholic menu, and when I went to order the non-alcoholic orange soda, I was told they didn't have it. The cashier wasn't polite or accommodating about it, in the least, he was actually kind of rude. When I went to order a bottled water, he did however offer the tap water, which is served in a jug, I was less than thrilled but opted for it regardless.I kept it simple, and went with the Kielbasa and fries. After you order, you then enter a big room and find a seat, simple enough. After a short wait we received our meals.Mine was exactly what I look for in a sausage, perfect and simple for me. The fries were delicious accompanied with a variety of sauces, you've gotta try the chipotle aioli! Also, to my surprise the water had cucumber in it, which made up for it being tap water.After we finished eating we ordered dessert at the back bar, which was probably the best ice cream sandwich I've ever had.

My first impression was instantly positive. Tucked away in the warehouse district, Wurstkuche is known for it's array of different sausages. In typical LA fashion, you can't go to a sausage place without having a solid vegan options. I went ahead and tried the Mexican chipotle sausage and fries. The fries were awesome. Huge slices, fresh potatoes, and perfectly salted. The sausage on the other hand? Unreal. I was absolutely stunned by the taste. It reminded me of year's past in my carnivorous days. The sausage was topped with sauerkraut, a toasted roll, and curry ketchup? Curry ketchup? AWESOME.So why only four stars? We went late on a weeknight and the place was jammed. I always enjoy seeing independent restaurants crowded but there was really nowhere to sit. I'm a little iffy on communal sitting. It was very loud and took a few minutes to find a spot.

They fill the void, here in Los Angeles, of a needed german influenced Sausage & Beer house. I could be wrong . . . but that's what I feel. With the back room of wood benches and flowing beers, on tap, Wurstkuche almost has the feel of a Beer Hall.In this unassuming building in the re-zoned industrial area of Los Angeles, Wurstküche dreams up some crazy sausages with exotic meats. Buffalo, Alligator, Duck, and Rattlesnake names jump at you from their menu, but appear to be normal menu items. One thing I liked is the different type of mouthwatering mustards available. I don't usually like mustard, but it goes really well on sausage. I personally liked the Whole Grain and Dijon. Along with the different mustards, they also feature multiple dipping sauces for their great fries. These fries are also really good as well. Not sure what else to say about them, they're just yummy. In addition, they also have a great selection of beers - Belgium and German Beers, on tap, too!I had the Duck & Bacon with Jalapeño Pepper sausage which was good. I remember it being better with the mustard than without, but I guess that's personally preference. My friend had the Kielbasa sausage, which was actually a bit better than mine. Like I said before, the fries were great - with the sauces. They also had a nice selection of bottle sodas.Anyways. . .

We noticed an outdoor patio on our way out which we should have taken advantage of while we were there. Next time.CONS - old school wood park bench seating indoors. NOT the least bit comfortable.- dark gray interiors only added to the sullen mood that the lady bartender and other staff members exuded (what is up with hipster folk?)- We were NOT full after finishing the sausages. With a normal sausage (outside of CA), the sausage is larger than the bun leaving little room for fries later on. That's the way I like it. This time around I had to gorge on mediocre fries.- Oh yeah, another CON- mediocre fries. Fries should be the easiest thing to make. Apparently not. They also LOOKED salty but barely had any salt taste. What was that stuff sprinkled on it then if not salt?-It's not cheap either. $28 for 2 sodas and 2 sausages and 1 large fry.

You order first out front and then go back into the beer hall and sit at large table. I don't drink but I do appreciate the ambiance there. The first time I went was on a tuesday night and though the food was good there was a young guy at the cash register with a bad attitude and when they brought the food the woman dropped it in front of my face and left. Didn't bother to ask if I needed anything. Seeing as it was my first time there, I was put off by the service. That said, the food is great, and both times back the service was much, much better so I think I was there on an off night. I do think they need to be nicer when they drop the food off.

I would give it 2 stars but someone has got to balance out the ridiculous amount of 5 star reviews for this place.

So plan on waiting for a seat.The most annoying thing about the wait is that you can't drink while your in line. The second most annoying thing about the wait, is all the people not eating or drinking but taking up seating and standing around staring at them until they get up. Even then you can't tell if they're holding seats for their friends at the back of the line or if they're done eating and just sitting there.As for the food, it's overpriced.  It's decent but the sausages are not very big at all.  I also bet no one could tell one of their sausages from something you can buy at the store at $5 for 4 sausages.The atmosphere is pure chaos. It's loud and full of kids.Good beer selection but again, overpriced. Honestly, if you want sausages and beer and a truly LA experience, go grab tall boy of Pabst wrap in a bag and go get some street meat in Echo Park.  You'll have way more fun and be way more satisfied."},{"date":"2013-06-11","rating":"4.0","review":"They know how to cook sausage.

The set up and décor are very similar. The dark wood, cool music, and the selection of beer. You place your order at the counter and find seating on your own. One big difference from Father's Office is that you don't necessarily have to 21+ to enter. To order drinks, yes, but not to hang out and eat.

That may not be the scene many are looking for but it's one that suited us fine since we brought our own little one with us.  Warning for young families though, they do not have highchairs.  It was a good thing we brought our own booster chair.  No worries for you kid-free hipsters out there, once the 6-6:30pm hour hit the lights dimmed, the music turned up, and the family crowd cleared out for the LA hipsters.  I hear the lines are ridiculous late at night (when they have a DJ spinning) but during the day it wasn't too bad.  We stood in a short line and found seats with no problems.Food: AA + for the duck with bacon - hubby loved it so much he didn't even offer the rest of us a bite  B+ for the mango jalepeno - good but hard to taste the subtleness of the flavors once you pile on the topping and mustardsC for the bockwurst - very mild, didn't stand out from your standard hot dog from anywhere but good for babies/children or those who don't like strong flavorsA- for bratwurst - my sis thoroughly enjoyed hers topped with sauerkrautA- for kielbasa - bro in law wolfed his down also topped with sauerkrautA- for Belgian fries drizzled with truffle oil...truffle oil makes everything taste better!  Our favorite dip was the chipotle ketchup.A for topping choices.  They are ALL good. I personally liked the sweet peppers and caramelized onions. And just a warning, the spicy peppers really are spicy!A- for the ice cream sandwich.  Apple ice cream sandwiched between chewy oatmeal cookies.  Mmmm!  Try this with their Floris Apple Ale.  It's a perfect combination!Ambiance: AService: B+Quick to clear tables and bartenders were nice.We can't wait to go back!"},{"date":"2011-04-02","rating":"2.0","review":"Worst coochayWurst coochie.

I like that their menu is simple: beer, brats, fries. The set up was really cool too bc you can go there for some beers or you can grab a bite to eat or both! And they have a dj set up so i'm guessing they have a dj play at night or on the weekends. We ordered: duck bacon brat: very good!! juicy, flavorful, winner.chicken apple brat: decent. basic. I went the safe route and safe is what I got. truffle oil fries: not a big fan of steak fries so my review may be biased. i'm not sure I can taste the truffle, but it was still good. curry ketchup: LOVED IT. I wish I could have purchased a bottle to go. chipotle aioli: Also good, but not as good. It's exactly what it is. Still yummy and worth trying. fruli beer (strawberry infused): SO DELICIOUS.

THANK YOU...Kept it simple this time with the Austin Blues and Santa Fe Jack Cheese and Peppers with onions and jalapeño peppers, along with a large order of Belgium fries with chipotle aioli and blue cheese dipping sauces. Although not bad, I wasn't able to find anything special about either sausage and not worth the wait outside. To be fair, I have the duck and bacon sausage on my first visit, which was much more memorable. And it's pretty impossible to hate against the fries though, of which I can eat pounds of. Of course, their beer selection is worth mentioning as well. Optimators make Gino happy. I really wanted to try their ice cream sandwich, but was on overload from the crowd and horrible DJ, so decided against it to make our way out of there.Wurstküche is more of an establishment to go people watch, and where you're forced to interact with some of these special people due to the \"community seating.\" Since it was much too difficult to have a conversation due to the blasting music by the horrendous DJ that couldn't mix for the life of him, we entertained ourselves scoping out the scene. A safe environment for all walks of life... from douchebags to hipsters, and everything in between.I MIGHT come back to try the rattlesnake... but only if it's NOT on the weekend, AND someone is treating me.

You'd think the whole waiting process would be over, but alas, you now have to wait for somewhere to sit. It's a little wonky the way they have the place set up...you wait to order, wait to sit, people sit around and drink and don't ever get up for those who are waiting for food. Seating is family style, so we eventually just had to squeeze our tushies in between two other parties.The food came out rather quickly and my beer, Delirium, which was recommended by the host/cocktail server, was pretty amazing. I ordered the jack cheese and jalapeno sausage and it was tasty, but it didn't blow my hair back. The fries, however, were just the right amount of crisp and had a perfect amount of seasoning. I should probably mention that I'm a french fry addict and it's really hard for me to NOT enjoy those artery clogging potato sticks.All in all, I'd definitely give it another go..just not on art walk night!"},{"date":"2013-07-01","rating":"4.0","review":"I'd eat here everyday if it weren't for the lines.

The food is not only tasty, but unique.  They have sausages that range from the your typical bockwursts and bratwurts, to sausages made from alligator, rabbit, and duck.I have tried many of their sausages and they are all good.  My favorites are the bratwurst and rattlesnake and rabbit with jalapeno peppers.  I usually put spicy peppers and sauerkraut on top.  I have also tried the vegetarian sausages and they could have fooled me!  They definitely taste as good as the \"real\" sausages. The sausages have a crisp \"snap\" from the casing and the buns are always toasted, never soggy.  To make these delicious sausages EVEN better, you can choose from five different types of mustard, including whole grain and spicy brown -- so happy!I also love love LOVE the double-dipped fries with dip.  My favorite dips are the chipotle ketchup and Tzatziki sauce.

A couple of minutes of looking at the menu and it felt like I was in Germany again. Now my profile mentions that I love sausage, but did I forget to mention I love dark beer. This place is great because not only do they have tasty sausages, they got great belgian and german beers - and the beers are mostly on tap! On my first visit I had the Duck/Jalapeno sausage and that was pretty darn good. On my second visitg (less than two weeks later) I had the Austin Blues AND the veal/pork/rabbit sausages. Both were excellent. Paired with a nice German dark (forgot the name) the meal really hit the spot. If you try this place out you might as well try the more exotics. Bratwurst is good, but the exotics are better. Their toppings are simple, sweet or spicy peppers, carmelized onions and one other. My recommendation is use the mustards, there are three types at the tables and people are always swiping them off the tables. The sweet mustard and the spicy are what I prefer, but hey theres regular mustard if neither of those fit your bill.The line was kinda crazy on a Saturday night, so head there on a different night so that you miss the crowds.

But spending $16 for lunch to eat good hot dogs is not my idea of awesome. I love to eat and can throw it down so 2 hot dogs is barely enough for me to be satisfied. Throw in a drink and it's a $20 hit. I have been a couple times where my sausage was overcooked which is off-putting. But when cooked right with some of their sweet peppers on there, they are tasty.

The line went quickly, but there was a rush of customers after we walked in - glad we missed being behind all of them.I ordered a Belgian IPA on tap (so good) and a sun dried tomato and mozzarella chicken sausage, topped with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. Also we ordered fries with truffle oil. Delicious. I was reminded of them because of a Yelp conversation I just commented on, \"the best thing you ever tasted with truffle oil.\" I can remember their crispy, savory thick-cut fries. The best I've ever had. I liked the sausage, too, served on a plain roll, but plain is good when there's so much other taste going on, like with the dipping sauces that come with the fries (curry ketchup, shallot something). I opted for the plain ketchup for the fries, though.To get from where you order the food to the seating area, you have to walk down a dark hall. Not weird. It's modern. Then there are picnic tables in the center of the large room at the end of the hall, also tables around the perimeter. There's a bar, too, for those who'd rather skip the fare and go straight for the great beers on tap.

Wurstkucke is located in the Arts District near Little Tokyo. Parking is a bit of a pain put not impossible. There's a lot on 3rd that you can use if you're desperate. Usually there a line out the door. Feel free to walk in side and grab a brown paper menu from the counter. Once inside, there's usually a host that asks you if you want any beer...this makes the wait more enjoyable. I highly suggest that you have your friend/friends go find seating while you wait and place the order. When it's busy, there aren't many options. The main dining hall is all the way in the back. There's also a small outdoor patio.There's every type of sausage and German/Belgian beer available. I keep it simple with the Kielbasa and Spaten Pils. Be prepared to drop about $20 on your meal...if you get fries. It's well worth it for the atmosphere.

I ought to have read the reviews first but I decided to stop by here on a last minute whim since I was in downtown LA on a Sunday evening. I had seen the place a few years back when we went to Zip Fusion for a friend's birthday and parked our cars near Wurstkuche. I dragged Ching with me & we decided we would be pigs and tried a bunch of things. We wanted to try the traditional bratwurst (ok) & the rattlesnake/rabbit (ended up tasting just like boring chicken). Ching wanted to try the Mexican chipotle vegetarian sausage (blech...i had only one taste and that was more than enough) & the duck/bacon (super herb-y tasting at first but then OK). I spoke with a couple in line who said they liked the Filipino best so I threw in an order of that as well. In the end, we could only finish 3 between us (the sausages are actually not as huge as you would imagine) and discarded most of the bread. We got the Belgian fries which were thick cut fries (nothing super terribly special but just nicely potato-ey) and good with the chipotle aioli sauce. The Bleu Cheese Walnut & Bacon dipping sauce was disappointing and tasted only like mayo. The girl who recommended the Filipino (how could this not be good seeing as how the Filipinos invented longanisa?) had tried the curry ketchup sauce before and said it tastes like ketchup with curry powder mixed in. I had glimpsed that someone enjoyed the apple beer here on Yelp so we shared an apple beer as well (hey, may as well load on the calories once you've committed to downing this much unhealthy food). One of the workers suggested we get a Franziskaner, a hefe weissen beer and it was good but if you're not a beer drinker (as I am not), I would stick with the Floris Apple Ale. Ching and I both agreed we probably wouldn't come back again. It seems more a young 20's hangout and Ching described it as \"LA hipster.\" Definitely a cool industrial urban looking place and good for large groups. So if you go here, definitely get the Filipino and the Belgian fries and some apple beer."},{"date":"2014-02-21","rating":"4.0","review":"delicious!! i love their duck and rattle snake and beer selection!! never get tired of this place!! been here with friends, and on dates! not so private but well worth it! i recommend their duck hot dog. i usually get it with onions and bell peppers and i recently tried their veil with white wine dog (courtesy of my NOW ex haha) i love everything!"},{"date":"2010-08-13","rating":"3.0","review":"Sorry Wurstküche, you left me wanting more. I was really excited to try this place after hearing so much hype. This is one of those situations where it couldn't live up to all of the hype. It's a great addition to Downtown LA and to the restaurant scene there, but the sausages were just okay. I tried the mango jalapeno chicken sausage as well as the duck and bacon sausage. In theory the duck and bacon sausage sounded awesome, but it was dry and lacked any complex flavors. I ended up enjoying the mango jalapeno more. The belgian fries were good. Again, nothing to write home about, but they do have interesting dipping sauces and great mustard. They also have a great selection of beers on tap. But judging the place on the merit of its sausages alone, it left me hanging.

Supposedly they make good German hot dogs and well, I'm not impressed. Yea, the hot dogs were good but something was missing, namely that there was no complementary fries. Each hot dog was at $6.50 and higher. When I saw those prices, I was like \"This hot dog better be the best damn hot dog I've ever tasted to be charging at those prices. Shit, it had better be better than Pink's Hot Dogs in West Hollywood.\" The seating was the classic high school bench style where everyone sits right next to each other. I didn't like that at all. Why? Because I didn't want some hipster douche bag scooting next to my side of the seat when I'm eating. I guess it's great for mingling with strangers if that's your thing but definitely not mine. Music was loud, maybe too loud now that I think about it. Lighting was adequate but dark in some areas. Ambiance? None. Well, actually I take that back. Ambiance just screamed out \"Douche bag, hipster, local, hippy artist joint.\" It's a sausage fest inside, literally. Moving on...I ordered the Austin Blues. I figured if I'm trying out their hot dogs for the first time, it's better to stick to what they are supposedly good at. My friend ordered the Mango Jalapeno and the Alligator & Pork, Smoked Andouille Sausage. When they finally came to our table at the bar because those were the only seats left anywhere in the building, I was very disappointed at the size of my hot dog. I had thought that maybe for the price I'm paying that it'd be bigger but no, it's actually a standard sized hot dog in a standard sized hot dog bun. You know, one of those buns you can easily find in Costco or a Ralphs Supermarket. The only thing special about the hot dog is that they make it themselves. I'm thinking about how to describe my hot dog and all I could think of is \"meh, it's spicy...it's meat.\" The Mango Jalapeno my friend ordered was a lot better. That one was actually tasty. Sweet, juicy, and spicy all at the same time. But alas, it's still too small of a hot dog. You'd need a good 4 or 5 to really feel full from eating it but that's an easy $30 meal right there. With $30, I could get full at another restaurant and still have money for more. I got the caramelized onions and sweet peppers for my toppings. They were good but nothing special. It's ordinary grilled onions and peppers. It's not like they add anything special to the toppings to give it a certain taste. I think this place is more appropriately a bar that happens to serve food and instead of burgers and fries, it's hot dog and fries. They do have a fine selection of uncommon beers but they are quite pricey as well. Most of them are priced at $8 a pint. I came away with a terrible experience here. The food was mediocre. Service was...non-existent although I did talk to some dude who looked like he might be the owner of the joint. He's a friendly guy who made some recommendations for what to try on the menu. Well, non-existent is a bit of an exaggeration. Clearly, it's not service-oriented but it's not to say that the servers or cashiers had a shitty attitude. They were nice and friendly but I don't know, I still came away from there with a not-so-good opinion of the place."},{"date":"2012-12-25","rating":"5.0","review":"I live a couple of blocks away and have to go there  at least once every 2 to three weeks.

I have to say, I wasn't expecting to like this place as much as I did. I heard it was a trendy hipster bar from my friends, and as much as I despise places like that I decided to check it out for the eff of it. We went on a Saturday night I believe, and for being a Saturday it wasn't too packed. We went in ordered our food from a kinda rude hipster girl *coughcough* and went inside to look for a seat. We found a table fairly quickly. It's a shame we couldn't catch a seat on the park benches that they have there. Just long benches where a bunch of people sit together and mingle, it's pretty cool. Next time. Anyway, we got some beer to start of, and man, does Wurstküche do beer right! They have a bunch of great beers on tap, it's pretty badass. I settled with a La Chouffe, which is a Belgian Ale if I'm not mistaken. It  was the shit. I'm seriously in love with that beer. It's smooth and creamy almost, and it packs a serious punch. You don't even notice that it's hitting you because it's so smooth. We got our food within 10 minutes. I had a Jalapeno and Mango hot dog with fries. I have to say it was pretty decent. I mean, it's no street hot dog, but it came close. It was very satisfying. I also got a side of fries and they were alright. The ketchup though! I got Chipotle and Curry ketchup. They were both great. The ketchup is what made them taste so great. Apparently they have a bunch of \"exotic\" hot dogs there. There's even a rabbit and snake one. I was too wimpy to try it that night, but my friend has tried it before and they say it was quite good. Me, I'm not so much into trying Thumper or Bambi. Maybe next time.The Dj there was playing good music. Points to them for that too. Last call was like at 1 I think. I really dont remember......Overall I'd say Wurstküche is highly recommended.

They're all really good, worth a try, but wasn't SUper amazing. the duck/bacon has a distinct taste and texture, more rubbery and rough, but still juicy if you get the grilled onions and sauerkraut on top. The rattlesnake/rabbit has more of a subtle taste. I really don't know how those two are suppose to taste, but it was good. Now that I tried its original taste, I would definitely get it with the pepper topping. Sun dried tomato one has a good tangy/hearty taste to it., not bad. I got there at around 7pm... right before the rush. self-serve water... which was a down side... cuz we had to keep going back for more"},{"date":"2013-03-16","rating":"3.0","review":"Few words to describe Wurstkuche:  Hip, fun, and urban.  It's rather small and it can get very noisy, but it's not meant to be intimate.  Great place to have a few drinks and gourmet sausages.  If you're feeling adventurous, try some links from their exotic fair, i.e., rabbit, venison, rattlesnake...for beer lovers, there is a myriad of beers to couple with your choice of meat.  Worth a try."},{"date":"2013-03-16","rating":"4.0","review":"really good stuff"},{"date":"2010-09-25","rating":"4.0","review":"Use your best judgement and you will have a good experience.This place is essentially hot dog stand inside a bar.  Not sure why they don't have a bacon wrap on the menu, but hey, not my restaurant.  It looks roomy and slick, and they do have a huge selection of sausages.and I mean huge...but look, do you think alligator tastes better than sun-dried tomatoes and mozzerella?  didn't think so.  I think the weird meats are too dry, so the sausages aren't as juicy as the normal ones.One of our guys sent back a sausage because it was too burnt.  Then again, they fixed it quickly so yay for good service.Still, the best thing here is...the fries.  I think they called them Belgian fries, and you can get them with truffle oil.  Call them whatever you want, those were some good fries.  Sausage wasn't too different than what you can do any sunday with a grill and a trip to Trader Joes.  Fries like this get you coming back.Oh yeah, they have a 5 dollar fancy bottle of Cola here.  It's about the same as a Mexican Coke..."},{"date":"2010-09-24","rating":"4.0","review":"So I came here on a Saturday night with my bf wanting to get a bit adventurous around 10 p.m. After all the things I heard about this place I had to finally see what the hype was all about.I walked into a cramped ordering space & noticed all the sausages & beer selection they had. I'm not a beer drinker at all ...literally I don't like it at all. I'm more of a wino/hard liquor type of gal. What the heck ..I was here so I'd thought I'd open up my drinking horizons. I wanted to start off light not get into the bitter taste of beer ..so the guy at the counter recommended St. Louis Framboise rasberry beer. I took a sip & wow!!! The flavor & crispness opened up my eyes to a new world.I literally became addicted it was so good!!! My bf got the Spaten Otenmeyer? if I remember correctly..strong with a coffee after taste not my thing.  I ended up ordering the rattlesnake & rabbit sausage with sweet peppers & carmelized onions. My bf ordered alligator & rabbit with onions & spicy peppers. We also ordered a Klein (small) fry with sundried tomato mayo. As I looked around for seating I didn't realize there was a back way. So I followed one of the servers & the place was huge!!They had big bench tables where everyone sit next to each other & a bar with a dj. Sweet!! So we sat down & tried the rattlesnake & rabbit first ...so good!!! I really like it especially with the whole grain mustard. The alligator sausage was also good & it has a bit of a fishy after taste but definitely worth eating again.I still can't get over the rasberry beer!!!! Oh no I like a beer ..this could be a good or bad thing but I can't wait to go back & get it again ..maybe even try strawberry next time.

Alligator no good. Duck, Bratwurst pretty good. Fries are good. Doesn't feel like a great value, I don't think its the best, but they have unique options as best. Beer: Good selection of beer. But some drafts can be served in pathetic sized glasses, two sips and your wondering where your $6 of beer went.  Nice fancy cups and all, but I'd rather just have them all in a predictable pint sized glass.Service: Non existent.  Terrible line. They need to improve that ordering line. Allow ordering at the bar or drop another register up front. Its incredibly inefficient and they lose out on biz when after your had a dog and beer you don't want to wait 20 mins in a line again for a second one.

I tend to ask questions about beers since I like trying different kinds and they always help me decide and even let me have a taster a few times. The guy at the register will usually suggest toppings that taste good with the sausage you order, which is nice. Tons of different sauces, I generally order extra since I'm a sauce fiend (I don't mind the additional .75 cents each). Fries are delicious....One possible down side can be the cafeteria seating which may not be great if you're bringing your parents (oops:). The music can be a little loud on the weekends (also not great for parental visits), but it's also nice to sit outside.

The slightly gamey and mildly spicy flavors were exceptionally tasty with the sauerkraut and grilled onions. And they have the best apple ale on earth!!! (along with a wide assortment of specialty beers). For those who prefer the normal proteins, there is a good selection of normal sausages to choose from, even vegetarian ones. There are also numerous specialty sodas to choose from as well.4 stars for the following reasons:1) The sausage-to-bun ratio was not so good...there was about 30% more bun than sausage. I think for $7.50 for the exotic sausages, they should make the sausage bigger to match the bun size.2) The only side you can get is Belgian fries, which were tasty but not exceptional. However, the blue cheese walnut and bacon and the chipotle were amazing! 3) Meter parking nearby is ok during off peak hours but can be difficult at night since the place gets packed at night.TIP: try to go early if you go for lunch. We got there at 12:15 and had to wait about 20 minutes to order and another 15 minutes to get our food, the 35 minute wait before getting our food really cuts into our 1 hour lunch."},{"date":"2012-02-08","rating":"5.0","review":"This is THE restaurant for college students - it has the right level of hip, urban feeling mixed with great meals at reasonable prices. You can taste multiple different meats, such as rattlesnake and rabbit, buffallo, and other exotic meats. The dipping sauces are delicious and should all be tried (best one, in my opinion (and the most authentically German one) is curry ketchup)! The only issue I have is that it sells itself to be a German restaurant, yet write \"groot\" instead of the German \"Gross\" for their large servings of fries... But if that's my only complaint, then that should tell you how good this place is."},{"date":"2013-03-12","rating":"5.0","review":"This place is amazing...the sausages are bomb...I have honestly tried almost all of them.

I ordered the Mango & Jalapeno sausage with sweet peppers & carmelized onions alongside some french fries drizzled with truffle oil. It was soooo yummy! I thought the Jalapeno would be too spicy and overpower the entire sausage, but with the mango it provided a really nice balance of flavors between the two. I definitely recommend getting the french fries with a drizzle of truffle oil because it will enhance all of your french fry expectations. I loved their Chipotle Aioli & Bleu Cheese dips for the fries. All of their soft drinks are all bottled and are a little pricey, but definitely worth it! Can't wait to try all their other sausages! Parking might be hard to find around this establishment and be ready to wait in line for maybe 30-35 minutes. Also, be ready to find a place to sit because it can be a bit hard, we had to eat outside in cold, but they have heaters outside, so the food & the heaters made up for the coldness. =]"},{"date":"2011-08-01","rating":"4.0","review":"What to get? 1) Any of their exotic sausages, probably the best of what they've got in flavor and experience.2) TRUFFLE FRIES.  Truffle oil makes everything better, including their fries.3) BEER!  They have a great selection of beers, and their communal-tabled brick-walled beer hall atmosphere is great."},{"date":"2011-06-06","rating":"4.0","review":"On my second visit, I had the Austin Blues (nice and spicy) with sweet peppers and caramelized onions which the person at the counter recommended and I was really happy with the suggestions!I had a bite of the rabbit/veal/pork sausage which was very flavorful and delicious, too.The curry ketchup is my fav sauce to go with the fries.Usually, I go in the late afternoon on a weekday so lines aren't an issue (and its quite quiet!) but if you're planning to go on a Friday night, be prepared for lines and a very loud dining experience (not necessarily bad, either)."},{"date":"2013-03-11","rating":"4.0","review":"I know there's tons of reviews and I have been here quite a few times.

First off, kind of hard to find...very unassuming. Ended up finding it because of the yellow and red stripes that I remembered from my friend's photos of the place. Line wasn't bad- took 5 mins to get our order in. Got the rattlesnake and the buffalo exotic sausages plus a small order of the frites. At first didn't know where to sit but went down the dark narrow hallway and found lots of benches to sit at. The wait for our food was a bit long....got so hungry!! When our food came out I went back to get 2 more- alligator and duck with bacon! Haha. Overall, the flavors of the sausages were yummy. The only one that stood out as exotic to me was the alligator- a very distinct gamey taste to it. I would say try that one out if you want to taste something that is out of the ordinary. Downside- buns!! Hard and chewy. The sausages were not as long as the bun so i tore off the bare bun parts. Oh, the chipotle aioli was yumm with the frites!!I want their sausages in me any day!"},{"date":"2010-10-26","rating":"3.0","review":"Came here over the summer.  Outstanding selection of Belgium and German beer! Plus got a great chuckle at seeing Pabst Blue Ribbon on the menu. Sausages were unexpectedly amazing! I had the mango jalapeno and it was fantastic! The sausages were smaller than I expected. I should have ordered two instead of one. The only thing that left a bad taste in my mouth was the excruciating wait to enter the place (a good 45+ minutes on a Saturday afternoon around 2:30 pm ish). We were completely surprised when we got into the main room to see an abundance of open seats. We were later appalled to see many people sneak in through the back door and side door to escape the line. If it weren't for the horrible wait, I'd give this 4 stars. Because the wait negatively impacted our experience, I will have to give it 3 stars. I would give Wurstkche another try.

As you stand in line, they come around and ask you what kind of beer or drink youd like. which is awesome. then you proceed to the brats. I had the rabbit, veal, pork, the Alligator, pork and the Duck Bacon and some fries.(dont hate, I love to eat lol) They were all delicious, I would have to say that the Duck bacon was the most flavorful so that one is a must.

My tips are:1. Have someone in your group arrive up to 30 minutes earlier to snag a place in line. We waited about 40 minutes to order, but this was during art walk.2. Enter on Traction - quite embarrassing to wander in from 3rd Street behind the DJ and just stand there looking around.3. Order the fries with truffle oil! That and the fabulous beer selection were the highlights for me.I ordered the Austin Blues with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. Perfection paired with the Pilsner Spaten.

Or can you even really taste the exotic animal you have chosen to devour?  Don't get me wrong, all the sausages, or at least the ones I've tried are all pretty good.. but it definitely isn't taste bud heaven explosion good.The prices are a bit high for sausages, but it is fitting with the experience and venue you get to enjoy them in.  Order in the front and walk to the back where it's like an Oktoberfest type of seating arrangement.  There are a good amount of normal tables along the wall and corner as well as a bar with lots of different beer on tap, which is a major plus to go along with your sausages and fries.  The weekday lunch wait isn't as bad as the weekend nights as expected, but still expect a 20+ minute wait minimum anytime you come during normal eating/drinking hours.Something different to drink or if you're the DD is the MR.

I ordered 3 sausages!  -- I shared one, ate 2. I love the rattlesnake with rabbit. I loved the duck with bacon. & I liked the alligator. I LOVE LOVE the hot peppers and onions... and lots of grainy mustard. DELICIOUS. I don't think anyone should go here and order a regular sausage.  The more \"exotic\" ones are really amazing! & pretty mild in flavor... so don't be scared! EAT THE RATTLESNAKE! The fries... were okay... I know people love and rave about them.  I like my fries very cripsy... and these were not.  The dipping sauces were amazing!  --- Never met a full of fat dipping sauce I didn't love.  BEER!  I loved the Dukelweizen, & We had a few of the Underbergs. the 44% alcohol beer that comes in a shot.

Usually when I come here I have to park a bit away and such which maybe a good idea after gorging down 1-2 rattlesnake/rabbit sausages and some nice german/belgian beers.I love the ambiance here with it's mostly young but cool crowd and dj spinning some indie to a diverse set of tunes. The crowd has always been pretty nice, never seen any trouble break out.

When I first walked in there was a pretty long line for a small place, was worried there would be no place to sit but outside in the cold. But luckily they had a really spacious area in the back with tables benches and even a little bar I think. We looked at the menu and saw some pretty delicious looking items, but we were there to try the exotics! So we quickly found them and decided to get the Duck & Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers, Alligator & Pork Smoked Andouille Sausage, and the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers. You can pick two toppings for each sausage you ordered (Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers, Spicy Peppers) Since we had 3, they were nice enough to put all 4 on the side for us. We also ordered the Groot (large size) Belgian fries, you can order it with two different sauces and they had a whole bunch to choose from, we chose the Chipotle Aioli & Pesto Mayo. Tried the duck and bacon first because it was the more normal sausages out of the three. Pretty darn tasty, the texture was a little tougher maybe from the Bacon? Next was the Gator, that was also pretty yummy but a bit too peppery. Next was the rattlesnake...my favorite. It was perfectly juicy and I liked the seasoning and how it had a bit of spiciness to it. It was probably one of the softer textured sausages too! The fries were awesome! I love thick fries with the skin still on it, nicely seasoned, didn't look greasy. My favorite dip out of the two where Chipotle Aioli, I love pesto, but pesto mayo was a bit weird with fries. The service was great, friendly. Clean environment, had complimentary water. Food came out pretty quick considering all the people that was ahead of us. If I lived in LA, would definitely come back to try the normal sausages too!"},{"date":"2011-09-07","rating":"4.0","review":"Came here on Sunday around 1230 and beat the crowd.  I ordered the Rattlesnack and Rabbit and BF ordered the Duck & Bacon.  His was a little dried while the Rattlesnake and Rabbit was fabulous and juicy.  Only one thing was the spicy peppers weren't a tad bit spicy..hm... A Plus for all the varieties of Mustard that they have.  Definitely brought out the flavoring.  As for sides, the Belgian double dipped fries.  Ordered the regular and and the truffle oil ones..   Love the truffle oil one and the plain were just plain.  As for dipping sauce, we got the Sundried tomato, bacon & cheese,  Chipotle and, Chipotle Ketchup.  Personal fav was the chipotle!! yummy!OMG this place has a huge variety of beers.  I ordered the Fruli which is fermented with strawberry...so delicious.  There really isn't much service since you order in the front and find a seating in the back.  But overall its good.  Wait for food is a little bit long but still bearable."},{"date":"2013-04-04","rating":"4.0","review":"I am a picky eater, but my husband and brother liked their rabbit and snake hot dogs.

Pro: - Loved the variety in meat options (Rattlesnake? Alligator? Coooool.) I got the rattlesnake and rabbit. It was tasty, but tough. I don't know if it was touch because it was cooked a certain way or because of the actual meat..- I got caramalized onions and sweet peppers and they were cooked perfectlyy. - Many different sauces for you to try with your fries :) I love variety. - FOUR different types of table mustard. This is the free mustard you get at your table. Yummmm.- Fun environment Con:- Lighting.. it was a little dark. I came here for a birthday party and I don't remember the faces of half the people I met. Okay, I'm exaggerating, but only by a little. - Is it really worth $12 for a hot dog and fries? That realllly depends and this place was.. Eh.        1. If I'm going to pay $12, then I was the bun to dog ratio to be              more dog than bun, which wasn't the case here. I want the bun               to be too small to contain all the yummy goodness.          2. The fries were mediocre. I didn't really enjoy it much. I give their              fries a 2.5. It tasted a little undercooked? I can't really pinpoint              what it was I didn't like, but maybe it gave the feel of it being              undercooked but it really wasn't. I don't know if that makes              sense. Haha.         3. Costco has $1.50 polish dogs that comes with a drink. (I know,               you can't even compare, but I had to put it in there)- The wait is super long. Beware. Overall, it was a great experience.

Also, Belgian fries!"},{"date":"2010-06-16","rating":"3.0","review":"Eat It or Beat It?**EAT IT!!**3.5 STARSWurstkuchu... oh all the hype and everything about sausages. Well, first off, no homo, but I enjoy my sausages and when I heard about this place, I knew I had to try it and forunately, one of my great friends happened to work there! Her and I went during a weekday (early evening) and fortunately there was NO LINE which is something I was very thankful for! The location is apparently in the \"Arts District\" in downtown L.A. and clearly, the people are very artsy and \"different\" I should say. Nevertheless, the ambiance of the restaurant was very chill. Although I never got a chance to experience the \"full-experience\" of hustle and bustle, I could very much imagine it in my head. Upon entering Wurstkuche, I noticed how TINY the ordering/front counter was... and immediately I thought to myself... hmm, many people waiting outside... small ordering counter... AH! Just like sprinkles (not quite that small)... great marketing strategy! In any case, I call the ambiance very \"hipster\" and as my friend told me, D-twn LA seems to try really hard to be all \"hipster-like\" such as Williamsburg, NY (the orgin of \"hipster\"), which by the way is a GREAT area to check out if you're in NYC! It's much like Wurstkuche: industrialized-ish area and slightly shady looking but very HIP! Now, onto the sausages:Rattlesnake/Rabbit Sausage w/ Peppers and Sauerkraut ($7.50):Alright, so upon taking a bite from this \"exotic\" dog, my first thought was hmm, very delicious... doesn't quite taste anything \"exotic\" that I haven't already tasted (maybe because I'm Asian and I've already eaten a bunch of weird disgusting shit (to the normal person) as it is). The sausage was definitely filling and there was a nice quiet crunch to the sausage... but quite honestly, nothing special. For a $7.50 sausage, I expected a bit more, but who am I to kid... I mean, what else can you do to a sausage? The peppers and sauerkraut was normal. Apple Vegetarian Sausage ($6ish):Definitely a different taste and unique in it's own way. I don't think I've ever had a vegetarian dog quite like this but yummy nonetheless!Belgian Fries:NOW, this is what I call delicious fries! Thick cuts with sea-salt and fried to perfection! Crunchy, not greasy, and delicious! Also, you choose from different sauces/dips and I had the pesto and some Asian sweet sourish sauce (eh). Pesto was the best one. CONCLUSION:I think what really gets to me is the price... I mean, the bill totaled to about $22 for just two sausages, a pelagrino, and small fries... hmm, but apart from that, the sausages were in fact delicious but next time, I'll be trying one of the more \"normal\" sausages and judge it based on that. Save yourself the extra dollar or two and just order a regular bratwurst (sausage). Additionally, next time, I'll definitely be trying one of their brews because it seems to be made in-house. Definitely check out this place and if you don't want to wait in the infamous long line... (WEEKDAYS, EARLY EVENING/DINNER)! According to my friend, as the night wears on, the more people, so beat the crowd! I'll definitely be coming back again and updating my review, so don't you worry Wurstkuche ;) Ambiance was definitely different and a PLUS, not too many of these around, so I say, EAT ITTT!!!!!"},{"date":"2013-04-01","rating":"4.0","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite spots in downtown LA.  Once inside, it will remind you of a German beer hall, it's loud, festive, and fun.  There is a large selection of sausages ranging from traditional bratwursts to more exotic types like buffalo, duck, rattlesnake, and crocodile.  I've had several different ones now and stick to the chicken apple, hot italian, and louisiana hot link.  The toppings add lots of flavor and is a must add.  Also a great selection of imported beers, enough to keep you drinking all night long!  Worth checking out, great place to meet up with co-workers, friends, and even a date place - of course that's not a first date, but maybe a fifth.  Downtown is in need of more fun places like this."},{"date":"2013-05-23","rating":"4.0","review":"Awesome food and great ambiance.

How can a exotic sausage/beer place be similar to a rave?  I'm glad you asked.Top 10 ways Wurstkuche is like a rave.1. Left house at 9pm to arrive in downtown LA industrial/arts district filled with warehouses and industrial buildings (and lofts, let's not forget the lofts).2.Found little place, despite supposedly being on E.3rd street, it is more accurately on Traction or however one spells it.  Nothing like GPS saying \"YOU ARE HERE\" when really, you aren't. 3. Trying to find parking down one way streets in areas one is unsure is allotted for parking.4. Waiting in VERY long line, in the cold (er, cool really), and being underdressed for the weather. Girls seem to experience this more than boys do. Also waiting in long line with vaguely drunk/high though trendy individuals who tend to meander like cats. Meanwhile other people yelling into phones \"WHERE ARE YOU NOW? HURRY UP THE LINE IS MOVING\"5. Some people getting in (probably those out for a smoke or joining party) bypassing line completely, to the confusion or frustration of others in line.6. Finally get to cash register to pay about 22-30 bucks a person (though at least I got a rattlesnake/rabbit sausage, beer, and fries and not just a stamp on my hand). Oh, instead of lollipops at a rave, get the Floris apple ale which tastes EXACTLY like a green jolly rancher. 7.DJ \"spinning\" electronica from his Mac--ah, the modern age--in a dimly lit room.8. There was definitely an energy to the place. Open seating which required you to invade the space of others, get close to strangers, bump up against strangers, be patient with strangers bumping up next to you, and yell to be heard. OH and ASIANS, everywhere, like raving circa 2000.9. Bouncers.10. Waking up the next morning with a dry mouth and rumbling stomach, feeling strangely dehydrated and the need for a hot shower.Not gonna lie. I liked it. Food was solid.

Unless I know you I could give a fug about you. The bartenders in the back are always cool, they say hello, get you your drink and leave you alone unless you feel like talking. The guy working the register, whom I believe may be one of the co-owners (I say \"the guy\" cause every time I've been here it's the same guy) is always in a shitty mood. Barely looks at you and just wants to get your order in, your cash and you on your way. I'd be a little happier if my restaurant was always packed.

Once you get past the name, Wurstküche, pronounced Verst-koo-shah, which is German for \"sausage kitchen\", your next feat is finding this spot. Wurstküche is located in the arts district in downtown Los Angeles, adjacent to the former location of Crazy Gideon's. Parking is generally easy to find, as there is quite a bit of street parking in the immediate area.On the outside, you're greeted by a large brick building with the name neatly placed above the entrance. Once you get closer to the door, chances are that there will be a fairly decent line, but don't worry...it goes pretty fast, plus, it gives you a chance to drool over the delicious sausage and beer choices that you have. The inside is raw, contemporary, and seems fitting of the area.As far as the food goes, it's delicious. You can't really make a bad decision with any of the sausage choices. Go ahead, try something different. You won't be disappointed. Some of my faves are: Buffalo, Beef & Pork with Chipotle Peppers, Duck & Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers, Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned with White Wine, and my top favorite: Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers. Make sure to get the toppings on the side so that you can try each sausage on its own first, then decide how you want to dress it.Next, add an order of the fries, and make sure to get the white truffle oil glaze. For the dipping sauces get the chipotle ketchup and the bleu cheese walnut and bacon. The fries are cooked perfect.As far as beverages go, you won't be disappointed. They have free spa water located in jugs against the wall in both the entrance area and the large hall dining room. They also have a fantastic selection of Belgium and German beers which you can order when you place your food order, or head up to the bar in the large dining hall.After you place your order, scurry down the long hall and take your pick of a seat in either the large dining hall with community picnic tables, or head outside and enjoy the beautiful LA weather.I love this place and highly recommend it. It makes for a nice outing to head downtown, have a lazy lunch & beer, then just walk around and take in our great city.pleaseaddbacon.com/2011/…"},{"date":"2011-04-03","rating":"4.0","review":"Not originally being from LA and feeling confined to the west side, what best way to venture out of my normal 10mile radius but when friends are in town from London? So overwhelmed by the internet, I turned to a trusty friend (who bears on the side of hipster) and told her that I needed somewhere new. I also mentioned downtown as I fancied giving my friends a different vibe than the westside where I currently live.. so on a Thursday night we end up at Wurstkuche.My friend visiting being into street art, was pleased at the choice of place as the surrounding areas had enough for him to picture. We found street parking easily and popped in.A glass counter with a choice of sausages, simple menu and easy prices ($6-$8 a sausage). I decided to go for simpleton. (None of the rattle snake esque options they had on the menu) Great selection of beers and sausages. No choice of bun but the bun is perfect as it is. Once you order, you walk through a dark corridor into the seating area.   We head outside (there's both inside and out seating) and are pleasantly surprised when the food comes. Buns grilled nicely, sausages were juicy and crispy on the outside - so had a good bite. Fries were great - the portion looks small when first served but is a good amount. Everyone was pleased with their meal - we had no issues..After eating we decide to move inside to get more of the \"bar\" feel. We struggled with seating (there were 7 of us) after about 20mins of awkward standing and eyeing people up - a few groups left and we spent the rest of the night chilling and drinking. Definitely a hipster vibe, good ambience and balance of mid 20s - early 30s folk. Easy eating, easy chillin' kinda place. I'd go back again."},{"date":"2010-07-22","rating":"5.0","review":"This place gets 5 stars for multiple reasons. #1. I was lost (I am not from LA)...so I called, feeling stupid and asked the guy if I was totally backwards or at least a little close by. I describe my surroundings and he tells me exactly where to go. Better yet, he asks me what kind of car I was driving so he could go outside and wave to me from the sidewalk. NOW THAT, is customer service at its best. Once I got inside, it just got better. He walks be back to where you order and everyone greets me like I am their best friends! Asking me if I had any questions, if it was my first time there... you know, being very friendly. Even the females were nice! That is a FEAT in my book. #2. The ambiance seems very hip and cool. I am a loner and went in by myself so I didn't want to sit at their picnic style tables and eat alone. (Got my food to go) BUT believe me, if I was with friends, I would have stayed. Very trendy and fun easy-going place to hang. #3. You have a wide variety of sausages to choose from. I had to get something exotic, so I chose the duck and bacon with jalapeños. Topped it off with nice caramelized onions. I am not a pepper fan so I was nervous how pungent the jalapeños were going to be and I was pleasantly and happily surprised that all the three flavors blend miraculously and I didn't feel like I was biting into a big ass jalapeño sausage. :) I also got the fries with the sundried tomato mayo (AMAZING). I washed it all down with a strawberry soda. I would love to try some of there many many beers, but like I said I was kickin' it solo. Honestly, everything was great. I will totally go back when I am back in the area.If you are in LA, looking for something different you should totally go here! Five full, perfectly earned and deserved stars from me!

I have been twice including one time for my birthday. Everything was great, the exotic sausages, the great selection of beer, and the fries with the delicious dipping sauces! The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that it was a little pricey. Maybe not for native LA'ers but I am from the Midwest where sausage and beer shouldn't put such a dent in your wallet- but it is really good- its just that I love to eat and could have put away my fair share of sausages and beer and would have walked out broke- happy but broke.

Oh, who am I kidding? I tried something from almost every category of the menu in one single meal.Rankings and comments follow.1. Rattlesnake & Rabbit w/ Jalapeno Peppers wins by far. Not a surprise since it was highly recommended by friends that had been here before. 2. Rabbit, Veal & Pork was next up, but kind of a far shot from Rattlesnake & Rabbit.3. Filipino Marharlika. Sweet, peppery, fatty. Probably wouldn't order this again since it wasn't really my thing.4. Duck & Bacon. Not terribly interesting despite the promising name (I love duck! I love bacon! Sigh), a bit dry. Multiple friends raved about the Chicken Apple sausage, but I didn't get a chance to sneak a nibble.Sausage toppings were generously slathered on all of them. The sausages taste pretty good even without the toppings.Belgian fries were okay. Dips were okay. Wouldn't get them again.Ice cream sandwich dessert was good, if that's your kind of thing. It was a toasted apple pie ice cream (less fruity than it sounds) sandwiched between two oatmeal raison cookies. Decently interesting beer selection. I had the smoked German one whose name I couldn't confidently pronounce. Pleasant.Mustards on the table.Utensils and water elusively placed on a side table near the exit. Cool bar inside.Rather crowded on a Saturday night. Be prepared to queue for awhile.Oh lordy, I shouldn't have eaten so much.

I like my sausage a little well done and it was cooked perfect from the first bite to the last bite it was excellent. My wife had the chicken and apple with hints of cinnamon - very good tasting sausage. She let me have a bite of it and the cinnamon is there but not overwhelming.

Vegetarian-wise loved the apple sage and mexican chipotle. Fries are absolutely delicious and I would come here just to munch on the fries.

I usually go on the weekends, and it can get REALLY crowded, so either be prepared to wait (first in line to order, and then for a table to become available) or go early in the evening. You order your food at the counter near the entrance and seat yourself in the back dining area; your food and drink is brought to your table. There's an additional bar in the dining area where you can conveniently get refills instead of walking back up to the front. There are some tables for couples and smaller groups, but most of the seating is at large, community picnic-style benches. My favorite sausages: buffalo, beef & pork with chipotle peppers, rattlesnake & rabbit, and the kielbasa. To be truthful, I've never had a *bad* sausage here.

Only in this great nation of ours, food is way more sacred than a paying customer. The lunch rush was just starting when we got there. I wimped out and did not get the alligator sausage (next year baby!). I got the mexican vegetarian chipotle sausage. WB decided to get us some belgian fries with some spicy mustard (almost like the home made one my mama used to make in Bengal). He got a beer as well. WB got the duck sausage which he rather liked. The fries were like manna from heaven to a carb addict like moi. My sausage was perfect. Biting into tubular food is what I love about lunch. We also got curry ketchup to honor all those Indians not eating with us. Sausage, spicy mustard, curry ketchup, big fat fries... a perfect lunch! Next time i am getting the gator."},{"date":"2010-08-03","rating":"5.0","review":"First off- I am not a huge fan of hot dogs. Don't get your pantiez in a bunch though, I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. I probably don't have to emphasize how good their rattlesnake dog is since everyone here raves about it. But I can and will have to agree- it lives up to its hype. For you non-adventurous folks out there, please give this a chance. It is worth letting go of all your inhibitions. The rattlesnake is made with rabbit meat. MMM...I love bugs bunny. A zangy  (zesty and tangy :P) combo (jalapeño peppers included in the dog too) . I also got to try their bratsworth. My friends and I were comparing it to the ones in Austin, TX around 6th street  that is offered after a night of rambunctious activities. I'm sorry Wurstkuche. Albeit, really good and decent, you do not win in this type of dog. The city Austin has it down. Note to newcomers, if you walk into the dark hallway, it leads to another side of the restaurant and is VERY huge compared to the tiny side where you order. Plus there's a bar for anyone who wants to grab a brewski to wash down their sausage dogs."},{"date":"2014-02-16","rating":"5.0","review":"delicious."},{"date":"2012-10-06","rating":"5.0","review":"The Bomb diggity, hip, happening fun and delicious! a little pricey but that atmospher is worth the cashiola and the fidd was awesom rattle snack and rabbit suasage with a fruli brewsky and fries sweet. this is place is a winner  for a weener!!!"},{"date":"2013-01-14","rating":"4.0","review":"Great food and beer!

It is in a pretty fun little area of the Art District and the front of the restaurant makes you wonder if not for the name being posted whether you got the right place or not. Upon first entrance it is just the bar with a cold case of the fresh sausages, the grill and the people behind the counter with 3 chairs and a counter like table. Down the hall is where you would enjoy your tastey treats with a great selection of German and Belgian beers to choose from both in the bottle and on tap. The seating is interesting, you can choose between a variety of mismatched steel tables, wood picnic tables in a light or unstained finish and an option of wire chairs, cinder blocks, modular white chairs or big comfy chairs that are honestly just too low to eat comfortably in but good for beer sipping. I had the mango and jalapeno pepper sausage or the \"Santa Fe\" . We ordered the white truffle oil fries with the blue cheese bacon dipping sauce and the Greek yogurt. I barely touched the Greek yogurt but that bacon cheese sauce was out of control it was so freaking good!Friends had the chicken apple, the duck with bacon, and the buffalo. All were ravenously devoured without issues. You also have a choice of like 4 mustard types to choose from and two toppings per dog. I chose the caramelized onions and sauerkraut. Overall I liked this place. I thought the price was good, about $15 for the beer, fries and sausage. Not too bad considering it is a pretty hip little place and although the fare is basically simple, the concept is snazzied up a bit.I think that if you are in the area and want a tasty little treat this is a fun place to hit up with some friends on a late night out."},{"date":"2011-08-08","rating":"5.0","review":"If you want to avoid the wait, go at lunchtime.

And the sausages.  I have been told that the Alligator wasn't so good.  I had the Rattlesnake and it was very good.  The guy at the register said that the Jack-Jalapeno was good.  I was told the buffalo and mango chipotle was good.  Also the fries with truffle oil are totally mandatory (especially if you like truffle flavor... and let's face it, who doesnt?).  The BBQ wasn't my favorite probably because I don't really like BBQ sauce with anything other than succulent, juicy, moist, fall off the bone BBQ.  The Chipotle, Pesto Mayo, and the Bleu Cheese Walnut Bacon sauces were so good (though i could do without the bacon on that one).So, bottom line -- nice crowd, decent price, fun food, good drinks.  I quite enjoyed sampling multiple sausages at Wurstkuche and I believe you will too."},{"date":"2011-01-03","rating":"5.0","review":"After being lost for 45 minutes, and find it in a lonely neighborhood where creepers might live...

Entering through the back will take you directly into the dining room, which is illuminated sparsely by scattered lighting (like most LA restaurants, I've noticed) and dominated by long tables and benches. The walls are flanked by additional, more intimate, seating arrangements and a bar.I made my way to the front and went straight for the exotics section ($7.50 per sausage) on the menu.With rattlesnake & rabbit and buffalo sausages, and fries with white truffle oil glaze on queue, I went back to the dining room with my glass of La Chouffe and waited about 10 minutes before dinner was served.The rattlesnake and rabbit, topped with caramelized onions, made the night. After getting through the tight casing, you are rewarded with a deliciously juicy sausage that is perfectly spiced. I am not one to eat spicy stuff and I could handle this quite easily, so if you're looking for a lot of kick from the jalapenos, you'd be disappointed. The buns could use a makeover though. It had a strong floury taste and made the meal dry.The truffle glazed fries were pungent and huge. When consulting the cashier about which size, klein or groot, to purchase, all he could say was, \"The large feeds two.\" But if you're not a big eater, it can feed at least three. At least it gave the opportunity to try two sauces. I didn't really care for the Thai Peanut, but the Sundried Tomato Mayo was a superb."},{"date":"2010-04-25","rating":"5.0","review":"I once saw a greeting card that read on the front, \"You hate your job?

It's so juicy and flavorful it almost feels sinful when you bite into it), Truffle Fries with the Chipotle Aioli and Buttermilk Ranch dipping sauces, and Lindenans Framboise Beer (yes, I know it's a girly beer but I like it) in a frosty glass.Those items combined with 15% off with KCRW membership and good company definitely help turn a bad day at work into a distant memory.

The Beer - I've tried the Früli, its pretty good if you like fruity beers, tastes like candy. My friend literally said the Floris Apple Ale tasted so good a baby would drink it. I second that. (Both bring very small portions). Another beer that was pretty good was the kwak, however, for how much it brings i dunno if i would pay that much again. Worth the price however are the Erdinger Dunkelweizen and the Koestritzer Schwarzbier. If you like dark beers these are good, but for a light beer Spaten Pils is a good choice.The Fries: Although i must admit they are pretty great, they seem a bit exaggerated by other yelpers. I didn't get the truffle oil though so i may have been missing out. The Tzatziki (Greek yogurt sauce) was AWESOME with my fries.

Having had no prior knowledge of the place, I was expecting a restaurant similar to Phillippe, but it was actually almost the opposite of those places.  The eating area was fairly hip and really crowded, almost like a cafeteria lounge-ish type of place.

(I have a huge snake phobia). The rattlesnake/rabbit tasted a tad bit gamey to me and it was by far my favorite.The mango jalapeno was good but not memorable.  I think that's what I get for ordering a sausage flavor that I can easily by at a Trader Joe's.  I'm sticking to the more exotic types for future visits.I was slightly disappointed with the lack of spiciness in our order.  All 3 of our orders had jalapeno but there was no heat at all.  I love spice so I would have enjoyed the dishes so much more if there was more spiciness in the sausages or condiments with some heat (additional jalapenos or a hot sauce).I wasn't the biggest fan of the Belgian fries but I'm more of a super crispy skinny fries person.  Their dipping sauces were awesome though!  We were only given 1 with our small order so we decided on the curry ketchup which was delish.The highlight of this meal was the beer selection.  They have a beer for everyone - girly beers and manly beers. I tasted the Fruli, Floris Apple Ale and the Van De Keizer.  The Fruli was a refreshing summer drink with a hint of strawberries.  The Floris was delish but it tasted more like sparkling apple cider.  The Keizer was a damn good strong ale - rich in flavor and smooth.  The Keizer was soo good that we each ordered another glass at the bar in the dining area."},{"date":"2011-02-14","rating":"3.0","review":"Hipsters and Hot Dogs.One of these things I liked, the other not so much.I will gladly eat there again, as long as I don't have to hang out with the people that live in the area. :o)"},{"date":"2010-05-30","rating":"4.0","review":"I've only been here twice, but I would definitely come back because I love me some grilled sausage with beer.  The sausages have been tasty, but nothing over the top.  I've only had the Sun Dried Tomato and Mozzarella (tasty), the Santa Fe Jack and Jalapenos (Spicy delicousness!), the Duck and Bacon (tasty, but I couldn't really taste the bacon... or the duck?), and the alligator (edible, but wouldn't order it again... it was very tough and a bit... fishy.)  VERY yummy Belgium fries which come with a variety of dipping sauces to choose from.  Chipotle Ketchup all the way.  The specialty beer is over priced, but hey, they have a great selection, and it's really all about the experience here.  I love the paper-covered communal tables.  I live about three miles away so it's totally convenient.  Come here for lunch, for a nice beer break away from the hustle and bustle of downtown LA.  Yeah, you'll find your fair share of hipsters here, but just drink enough beer and you'll soon forget about 'em."},{"date":"2011-04-01","rating":"5.0","review":"Most of the 1000+ review club restaurants I found overated..Wurstuche was an exception.  It really was as good as it gets.The sausages are decent price, wrapped in a nice & chewy German bread.The thick fries are awesome, we got two dipping sauce: curry ketchup and thai peanut, both add a little spice and kick to the fries.*be careful on the beer, they are high quality and high price.  I got the St Bernarusd Abt 12, which is very smooth & creamy for a 10% dark ale.  For $8, it's like having 2 beers (in term of alcohol content).*Oh, did anybody mention the fancy cucumber water?  I feel like a peasant for saying this... but that free cucumber water is delicious.

Then when you get to the table there are seven different kinds of mustards chose from. I was very satisfied with what I ended up picking. I got the apple smoked sausage and topped it with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. Then added honey mustered at the table- such a great combo! Definitely tasted great with the pilsner beer I was drinking. Although the line to get in was really long (you order at the counter then sit down), one of the servers took our beer order and delivered them to us while we were still waiting. The ambiance is a little different than what you would expect. Very dimly lit and there is a DJ which made me feel like I was in a night club. The music wasn't too loud but it was pretty crowded and noisy to the point where you could have trouble hearing. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. Especially for those who haven't seen all the revitalization and renaissance downtown is currently experiencing."},{"date":"2009-09-21","rating":"5.0","review":"Good Food Good Beer.I met my first ex wife at WURSTKUCHE.Thanks!"},{"date":"2011-05-23","rating":"5.0","review":"Pro the food is great you cant go wrong with what you getCon it can be really busy aka you wont find a place to sit but i will def be coming back"},{"date":"2012-07-26","rating":"4.0","review":"i hear that crazy gideons guy closed his shop and opened up his new business ;pi'm kidding, but this place is near where crazy gideons used to be.i been here once and it looked like a fun place to just relax and eat!? :)"},{"date":"2012-10-21","rating":"5.0","review":"Good food, good service, great beer.  Love this place!  Just wish it was closer to my house."},{"date":"2010-07-08","rating":"4.0","review":"Waited an hour in line for this place!

The chicken and apple was also good- had a hint of cinnamon in it and was also very juicy. Rabbit and veal was a bit dry and bland for me. We ordered 4 orders of fries (amazing) for 4 people so we got to try 8/10 of the dipping sauces. My favorite was the curry ketchup  and the bleu cheese walnut and bacon. Seating is cafeteria style here and you gotta fight for your seats! Our group stood around for like 10 minutes before we were able to get a table outside. Seating outside was sketch cause the cement was uneven and had a lot of cracks in it so our chair/ tables kept moving around etc. We then moved inside and it was fine.   A lot of Beers on tap here, I had the floris apple ale (it was okay, I'm not much of an alcohol person)..

The sausage is good too but I was really into the sauce. The line is usually long and the place is always packed but you have time to stand around to swoop a table before your order comes. If you come with a group of friends during a crowded time, I suggest you all stand on different corners of the room & ask parties who look like they are leaving if you can take their spots. Beware of the rude hungry people who bark at you for attempting to steal their tables though, when of course, you're simply finding a place to sit!

When you walk in, it has a cool rustic look with cement walls, and cement floors with high ceilings and low dim light. As you go to the back where the seating area is located, you will find 3 long tables with long benches the same length as the table somewhat of a cafeteria type in high school  where everyone just sits wherever. But of course, along the windows are single chairs and tables as well as the stage area section. I did notice that there was a dj booth next to the stage. My co-worker who recommended we go try that place said that they have music on saturday nights.Now on to the food...Duck/bacon sausage is not for the faint at heart...that is definitely one to try. I also had the Buffalo, Beef & Port with Chipotle Peppers and that one was as exotic as the duck. Nice crunch with the carmelized onions and bellpeppers tops off the whole hotdog experience. Although, I have to admit the sausage is smaller than the bun.When I got the my order brought to the table at first, I was amazed at the gorgeous well dressed staff and made me wonder hmmmm....and then I looked at the order and it looked huge overflowing with onions and bellpeper but then hey, she was hot...so I had to stare at her again as she walked away and then of course, I preceded to dig in but after a couple of bites, I noticed I didn't hit the sausage yet. It was hiding all the way at the bottom. Let's face it, this is not the Dodger Foot Long but still for $7.50 for an exotic sausage at least give us more meat.Now, their fries is totally a different thing. Great tasting, cooked well, great crunch and flavor was off the hook. What's even better is that they have different flavored dips that you chose to go with your fries so you don't have to settle with just the usual ketchup route.I didn't even try the different type of beers they served. Most of my co-workers did and they all tried daffodil flavored, apple cider flavored and some other flavors that I can't remember.Overall the place is good. Sausages are fantastic.

But not your ordinary hot dog joint. Your choices are pretty simple. Hot dog, big hot dog, Alligator? Rattlesnake? Woah now things are getting interesting.I can tell this place is infested with locals, the crowd is very very mixed from hipsters to gangbangers (nice gangbangers, i hope) especially since this is off in the outskirts of little tokyo, this is one of those \"if you know, then you know\" kinda places.When you walk in theres a cashier, counter, standard. But then the dining area is down this crazy giant dark hallway that opens up into a huge like swanky-industrial school cafeteria with shared benches to sit on and awkward \"oh is this seat taken?\" conversations constantly. Beer selection was awesome. I had beers I couldnt even pronounce that how cool it was.Rattlesnake dog was good. But damn those fries are what keep my mouth watering when I think of this place. The best part are the dipping sauces. Curry ketchup? Bomb. Spicy ketchup? Bomb-er.Definetely a good spot to take a of-age drinking buddy (or not-of-age- wink wink nudge nudge) plop down, enjoy some fries and a dog. This aint no pinks, table service with a number so they bring your stuff to your table. All in all worth the experience for a chill hip \"L.A.\" kinda place for all you out of towners.I think fri sat are probably the busiest so if you dont like crowds dont go around then because parking is a b-tch.

The wait for food can sometimes be a little long, but you'll probably be going with a group of friends so think of it as more time to talk and socialize! It'll also give you time to figure out exactly what you'll want to order, and IMHO it's worth the wait to try what Wurstkuche has to offer. After all, who DOESN'T like juicy, exotic sausages in their mouth? (Insert joke/disgust here) You get your choice of 2 quality toppings per sausage, with things like caramelized onions or sweet peppers to choose from. I'm a fan of the fries with truffle oil, and a small order nets you a choice of one of their many dipping sauces, while a large order nets you 2 choices of dipping sauces.The seating area is open so you kinda just have to look around for a spot to open up when it's crowded, but I've never had to wait too long and have always gotten a seat before my food arrived (think In-N-Out).

I did not try any of their drinks/alcohols because I was massively inebriated the night before. I just had their water, which tasted like watermelon. It went well with my rattlesnake and rabbit sausage! The food did not take very long which was a plus, considering that place was loaded with hipsters. I can easily lose my appetite by just the slight sighting of them. If you're that much allergic to hipsters, then take your sausage to go, but you have to try the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage. I also tried the duck and bacon (a bite), a bit spicier than the snake. You'd think the snake was spicier but wasn't. The duck hardly tasted like a duck, and I've tried different kinds of duck dishes before. I'd definitely eat here again despite the ego all over the place.**I'm sure I butchered the name.

My boyfriend and I came here late at night after the Skidazzle convention after my boyfriend's cousins had told us to stop by this place for a midnight snack. Seeing as I'm an OC person by heart, I NEEDED to try out LA food for the experience. Parking was pretty scarce and I thought the neighborhood was a little scary, but it all turned out fine at the end. (It helped that there was some kind of bouncer/guard at a nearby restaurant keeping a good look out.) There was already a line going out the door by the time we got there, but luckily, the lines went by pretty fast. One order of rattlesnake and rabbit wiener with sauerkraut and caramelized onions and one small belgium fries with chipotle ketchup coming up! $12 or $13 total? Not bad! No beers, considering I'm not much of a drinker. ;3It was the back dining area that really surprised me when we were waiting for our dogs. There was loud music bouncing off the walls and people yelling over the music but generally having a great time. A full bar, dimmed lights and muted windows to block out the street lights outside. It reminded me of those Hollywood bars I often saw on TV. It was crowded, but we managed to find a spot on one of the long benches. It didn't take too long before our food came out.OH MY GOSH. It was the most delicious hot dogs I've ever eaten, which to be truthful isn't saying much, since I'm not much of a wiener person in the first place. Haha. But no, really, it was AMAZING.

When a sizable weekend lunch crowd took over the space it got kind of tight, but if you're dining in you go down the long forbidding-looking hallway to the large, light-filled communal dining area in the back. I liked the long tables with the bench seating, and they were playing some very cool electronic music. I got the bratwurst with saurkraut and spicy peppers, along with an order of the Belgian fries and chipotle aioli. Both were very good, but the fries could've been a little fresher--I was hoping it'd come to the table hot, but it was just kinda warm. Still, thick-cut and double-fried, it was mighty tasty. The sausage was perfectly cooked, all juicy but with a slight bit of crunchy char on a nicely soft-yet-substantial bun. Compared to Valhalla Table in Costa Mesa, its OC doppleganger, it was superior in style, selection, and execution, but I thought the Valhalla fries were better. Didn't sample any of the beers--wasn't feeling it quite then, but definitely next time. I thought Easter would be a good time to try the rabbit and rattlesnake sausage, but maybe next year.

Now I've been here number of times, with many different groups of people, but no one could tell me how to pronounce it correctly. I heard people call it, \"Wurst-kuchi\" or \"Vurst-kuchi\" (like me). According to my German co- worker (i just asked him), it is more like \"Voorst-Ky-chay\". Or, we can just call it \"that damn good German sausage place in downtown\". :)My favorite ones to get here are Bratwurst, Mango Jalapeno, Rabbit, Veal & Pork, Alligator & Pork, and Sun Dried Tomato & Mozzarella. If you are not sure about the toppings for each one, ask for the recommendations, and they will know what goes best with your choice of sausage. Don't be scared to try the exotic ones like Alligator or Rattlesnake, you don't taste anything weird, and they are all very, very delicious.  I recommend going in a small group and ordering all different kinds to share.  This is a HIP place in downtown (yes, still), expect to wait in line for 15+ min (depend on what time you get there) on weekend nights. I can't give you any advice on selection of beer here since I don't drink beer, but they have a full bar and also a cherry ginger beer!! Yum!

Upon first looks (or just a casual walk by), you'd assume it's some hipster dance party (judgements base only on the people seen clustered outside the restaurant and the music bleeding through the speakers and seeping through the walls), but really, it's a socially active and pretty great place for a casual night out. There isn't a ton of seating, only because there are so many people there that seats become something coveted and of great value, so you'll either have to get there early or be stealth.  Outside seating is always full, but that's where the best seats are. It isn't as boisterous and if it's summer, then it's perfect. The different types of sausages is to die for. I haven't tried anything too exotic (only had the duck and also the vegetarian), but can't wait to come back and try them all. Everything there is succulent and filled to the brim with flavour. The sausages are perfectly cooked and there's even some snap to them, which is a big deal to me. Don't forget to try their French fried because OHMYSWEETBABYJESUS! That truffle oil.

This was a spicy pork sauce with hot peppers.  It was tasty and perfectly cooked but didn't necessarily stand out from other sausages I've had.- Large fries with curry ketchup and BBQ sauce.  Fries were tasty, but I'd probably order different sauces.  They were both just okay.The place had a great vibe and I really like the decor and overall feel.  I could do without the bun as it was not super soft and a bit too doughy for me.  I could also do without the wait and the loud music.  Overall I would come back for the exotic sausages but only if I was in the area, the wait is a bit too much after a trek from the westside."},{"date":"2013-12-23","rating":"5.0","review":"Truffle fries!!"},{"date":"2011-03-06","rating":"5.0","review":"I had:Rabbit and Rattlesnake with Jalapeno, Duck and Bacon with Jalapeno, Mango and something with Jalapeno Fries and these toppings: Caramelized onions and Spicy peppers.Sauces:Chipotle Ketchup, Curry Ketchup, Chipotle Aoili, Pesto Mayo.Duck and bacon was more flavorful i guess than the rabbit and rattle snake but they were all really good.

Instead, I find myself appreciating the concept, but underwhelmed by the actual food - is this what the big deal is all about?At first glance, I totally get why Wurstkuche has been such a huge hit in LA- smack dab in between Little Tokyo and the Arts District, with an exotic-sounding name and a Gen-Y aesthetic. I must've missed this place at least 4-5 times while driving through the area, partly because the restaurant marquee is on the side of the restaurant facing a warehouse- hard to spot at night unless you notice the line of people standing outside. Inside, it's like a cafeteria for adults, but with fine wooden tables and trendy metal side tables.So it looks cool and hip, but what about the food? I've had the white wine, rabbit, & veal and rattlesnake & rabbit - I liked the former better than the latter, although the latter is apparently one of their top sellers. I just felt the bread was too big for the sausage- I would've preferred if the bun was half the size, so I didn't have a mouthful of bread after my first and last bite. The toppings (peppers, sauerkraut, grilled onions, etc.) help, but gets pretty messy because of the way it's piled on top of the bread.What was quite good, however, was the Belgian fries! We had it with the buttermilk sauce and pesto mayo- both were delicious! I think the next time I go to Wurstkuche I'll order one of their more \"normal\" sausages and have a large order of fries all to myself- it's THAT good!All in all, I'd definitely come here again, but not if I have to wait longer than 15 minutes to order. The food is kinda pricey ($8 a sausage is a bit much, especially when they use that kind of bread), but it's a good change of pace if you're in Little Tokyo and don't feel like eating Japanese. Of course, another redeeming quality is the fact that this place is Trojan-owned (FTW!), and I suspect that I would enjoy myself more next time if I had a beer in my hand.

And despite the late night, there was a line right out the door. And as we waited for our turn, the people around us were raving about the exotic sausages that they serve, particularly the Rattlesnake Sausage. Oh, you heard right.The appeal of this place is for their sausages and beer, but particularly their exotic meats turned into tubes of food... buffalo, alligator, veal, rabbit...I got to sample the Rattlesnake/Rabbit and the Alligator/Pork. I'd highly recommend the former, as that was soft and moist, with a pleasant kick to it. Since I don't drink, I tried the Curiosity Cola, which tasted like root beer (it probably is). Their thick-cut fries are pretty decent.We sat by the entrance of the place, which made it feel very claustrophobic. From what I saw though, there is a more spacious space in the back, with a DJ and proper seating.Parking streetside. I'd like to see if it's still packed during off-meal hours. Being close to the Art community, that's the kind of regulars you'd see there.For the Rattlesnake/Rabbit Sausage alone, I'd give it a 4.

Couldn't really taste any jalapenos. Tried the rattlesnake rabbit one. It definitely had a better flavor but I don't feel as though it will ever be something I crave for.The fries were on hit though. If you've ever been to Pomme Frites in New York, i'd say the fries here at Wurstkuche could give Pomme Frites a run for its money. Dipping sauces can vary. I had the sweet n sassy bbq sauce and the blue cheese w/ bacon & walnut mayo. The bbq sauce is not really sweet  n sassy at all, skip it. The blue cheese w/ bacon and walnuts is worth it. I mean I guess it's a great spot to try just to say you've had it but it's definitely not at the top of my list for L.A.

My friends ordered rattlesnake and rabbit, and sundried tomato mozzeralla.I have to say, I was not pleased with the duck and bacon. It must be opposite of what the menu tasted, but it was anything but juicy and packed with flavor.. it was dry and flavorless. I found it hard to eat my sausage dog. I also tried the rattlesnake and rabbit. It didn't do much for me.. But I did like the gourmet dog, sundried tomato and mozzarella. Next time, if I do come back I will just get a normal gourmet sausage dog.I got fries with the truffle oil, and I must say they serve some very lackluster fries. Half of the batch was burnt, so it was difficult to eat. I guess it's good for the waistline and bad for the tastebuds since I barely had any.I do love the ambiance and vibe though.

The staff was really cool- efficient, personable. And the sausage was pretty amazing. I liked the vibe of the whole place, with the kind of minimalist decor and dim lights but full-flavored, savory sausage. I like that it wasn't just straight-up wurst, that gets boring really fast.

I finally got a card from them and looked it up. Not a shocker that it had great reviews. It's a cool looking place with a slew of nice and sometimes obnoxious artsy fem-nerd-snobs who make metrosexuals look like Moose from Archie. Not the sort of people who you would imagine drink beer and eat \"manly\" sausages.Anyway, if you take away the ambiance which is wanabee meat-packing NY, what are you left with?Grilled Sausages- some tasty, and some not, that are way overpriced and kind of dinky. My favorite is the chicken with some kind of chile/spice inside. The snake and alligator were just not too good although how cute to listen to conversations about environmentalism and animals rights while the same people chomp them down. The rest fluctuate between great and bad. You just need to try them and see what does it for you.Sometimes the toppings are fresh and tasty. Other times...not. I don't like a crap shoot in a restaurant, especially when I bring a guest but this place is definitely one of those types of experiences. It could be a 5 (and it has been) or a 1 (been that too).I have spent well over 80-100 bucks for two people here, eating and having a few beers. And we were both still kind of hungry. You will be surprised how much things add up when 2 sausages, a fry and 2 beers are over 25 bucks.The fries are usually good but many times they have been sitting around and are not up to standard. Still, where else can you get authentic tzaziki dipping sauce in Little Tokyo (spitz does not measure up).The beer selection is great but was much better when they had Delirium Noctornum - my favorite! Why they got rid of this brand, I will never understand. It tasted like raspberries.Anyway, its kind of a little pretentious in here. Like a bad school cafeteria populated by many of the people who like to hang at the Mac shop and brainwash themselves that they hold the matrix in their i-phone. But you can have fun here and believe it or not, there are some nice people to meet squished in between the momos.On little issue is that often the server will not be able to find you in the mess or people or will just give up and your food may sit up front for 20-30 minutes. And they will not let you order food from the bar area which is silly silly.Anyway, it's not great. And it's not bad. If the prices were more reasonable, and the portions larger, I would be here on a regular basis. Considered one step away from greatness. Who knows...they just might get there with experience and complaints from the Hanbaga-San."},{"date":"2010-04-14","rating":"3.0","review":"Sausage Kitchen...I wanted to love you. I really did.

I was thrown off at first because I thought it would be more like a restaurant and not a fancy fast food place. The place was done up really nicely and the beer selection was pretty good too. I ordered the bratwurst with sauerkraut and spicy peppers. What made me take off a couple of stars was the kraut. It wasn't flavorful enough and how can you eat bratwurst without kraut?!??! That is the definition of deustchland. It was served on a bun, which was too bready for me (yes I like to create words). The mustards were all over the place, and I had to go from table to table like a vulture to grab the brown mustard. And the peppers were NOT spicy. I do not like bellpeppers,but I guess green bellpeppers were their version of spicy peppers. The bratwurst was tasty, but after going to some German restaurant in SF, this one just doesn't compare. Their truffle oil fries were amazing however. So kuddos for that. I will however not shut myself from trying all their other options so I will be back....

Wurstkuche is located on the outskirts of Downtown L.A., in an industrial type area. In fact I think Wurstkuche used to be an old warehouse. To get into Wurstkuche we had to wait in a fairly long line that was wrapping around the front of the restaurant.Once you get inside you find yourself in a small room where all their hot dogs are on display and where you place your order. After your order is placed you get a number to set on your table and then you have to walk down a long dark hallway that leads into the dining room. The dining room is a pretty big room that offers three different places you can sit. The first is at the bar, the second is long picnic tables that are in the middle of the room, and the third is some small coffin shaped metal tables that are lined up against the walls. We chose to sit at the later of the three.Since I had never been here before I decided to order three of their exotic dogs. I went with a duck with bacon and jalapeño dog, an alligator with pork dog, and a rattlesnake with rabbit and jalapeño dog. My GF was not as brave. She played it safe and went with a Kielbasa and a turkey Santa Fe jack cheese and jalapeño dog.  All three of my exotic dogs were delicious. Each one had its own unique taste. The duck and rattlesnake were both somewhat spicy but in a flavorful way. The gator and pork, which was my favorite of the three, had an awesome smoky flavor. I topped all three of my dogs with grilled onions and sweet and spicy peppers. I also spread some of their amazing pesto mayo on all three of my dogs. Both of my girls dogs were both great as well. We also shared a large order of their double dipped Belgian fries with a white truffle oil glaze. These fries were big, salty, and extremely crunchy. I loved them. Just like all other Gastropub's, Wurstkuche has an extensive beer list but I was only hoping they had one in general. The beer I'm referring to is Chimay and they had it available in both their red ands blue flavors, which made me happy. Wurstkuche also offers some gourmet sodas, which we tried as well.One of my favorite things about Wurstkuche was the atmosphere and all the different types of folks who were dining there on the night we went. That Sunday Wurstkuche was packed full of men in business suits, hipsters, young couples, old couples, straight couples, gay couples, and tourists, it reminded me of Disneyland . That day my girl and I were sandwiched between two groups that were having some pretty interesting conversations. On our left were two Asian women, both of whom were dressed kind of shabby, drinking huge beers. These women were talking about how their tired of being mistreated by the men in their lives. To our right were two men who were discussing a party they had been to the night before and how the parties host, whose name was Brad, looked so hot in his too tight, too reveling jeans. Lets just say my girl and I were very entertained during dinner. I thought that the vibe in this place was amazing. Besides the two unhappy male hating women on our left, everyone else inside of the restaurant seemed to be having a great time.The service here was wonderful. Even though the line was really long it only took us ten minutes to place our order. Once our order was placed it only took another ten minutes to actually receive our food. The prices are a little high here. For our five dogs, the fries, two sodas and a Chimay it was about $65 dollars. I had never paid that much at a hot dog joint before but this is not your average hot dog joint. Even though this place is pricey I know I will be back again soon to try some of their other delicious sounding dogs.If you have not already been here before I highly recommend you do. Wurstkuche is one of those places that I think everyone should try at least once in their lives. Don't forget to try the gator."},{"date":"2013-02-16","rating":"4.0","review":"Great stuff, I like the industrial/minimalist design, had a very good waiter, recommended."},{"date":"2010-07-11","rating":"5.0","review":"HMMMM sausages and beers, this pretty much sums up this place. No I am not talking about the dorm rooms back in the college days.All of the people that I brought to this place, started off by laughing about it to absolutely fell in love with it. This is how good this place is. Though there are already 1000+ reviews for this place, but I think it deserves one more raving review.If you havent heard or tried this place, what have you been doing? If you consider yourself to be a food or beer enthusiast, or simply just alcholic like me, this is the place to be.This place has a very good and exotic collection of sausages, ranging from authentic Louisiana Hotlinks to Rattlesnake and Alligator meat sausages. I have tried most of the flavors here, and none has disappoint yet. My personal favorite is Duck, Louisiana Hotlinks, and Manager Jalapeno. Definitely try to Alligator and rattlesnake sausages too.In addition, please do yourself a favor and order the fries with your sausage. The fries here are out of this world. My gf is a french fries fanatic, and she absolutely love the fries here. In addition, they also offer a wide selection of creative dipping sauces like my personal favorite curry ketchup, pesto mayo, and buttermilk ranch. I mean, how and who da heck came up with these creative and delicious dipping sauce recipes??? Who thought that by adding curry into a ketchup would be so delicious? Bomb.Last but not least, this place offers the best beer selection that I have ever tasted. Being an ex-alcholic, or maybe more like part-time alcholic now. I had my fair share of taste on various wines, hard liquor, and beers. And I have to say the beers here are one of the best I have ever had. My personal recommendation is to go with Franskaner, Duvel, or Chimay. The St Louis Framboise (raspberry flavor beer) is a good choice for the girls. In addition, if you are feeling adventurous, you can also try a beer called Rauchbier. This beer smells and taste very much like Bacon, yes, Bacon! Well, to be precise, this is a smoke dark ale, and hence there is a very intense smoke flavor.However, as a last note, if you do decide to give this place a try, you might wanna do so during off hour. If you are here during the rush hour (7~10 pm), then have fun waiting outside as well as finding a seat inside."},{"date":"2010-02-21","rating":"5.0","review":"The owners of this popular Los Angeles gastropub should consider changing the name from Wurstkuche to Bestkuche because they serve up some of the most unique and flavorful kuche's outside of Las Vegas.  With over 20 different types of sausages to choose from (including 3 vegetarian options), this sausage brothel has something for everyone.  Spicy kuche's, German kuche's,veggie kuche's, juicy kuche's, you name it they've got it and from what I've experienced there simply is no kuche like a Wurstkuche!For those of you who haven't been, I would compare this place to a sausage version of Fathers Office.  Its a little bit urban, a whole lot of cool, and filled with people looking to enjoy a unique LA experience. Plus the set up is quite similar.  Place your order, grab a seat and enjoy the company of your friends. Not to mention the fact that their beer selection is top notch.  They even offer a 6L magnum sized Duvel Reserve for the low low price of $250.   Now moving onto the food.  We ordered 4 different sausages and passed around our kuche's like it was an old school porno starring Jenna Jamison.  I would say that this is your best bet if you're looking to have a taste of what they have to offer. Among our selections were the duck with bacon, their classic brat, the austin blues, and the veggie italian.  All were quite good and very unique in flavor and texture.  In my personal opinion I found that the classic brat was the best, followed by the austin blues which had just enough kick to it.  The duck was a tad over seasoned, in fact I thought it had too much flavor but it was good nonetheless. We also added 2 orders of their Belgian style Fries to our meal and OMFG these things were good.  They're sliced a bit thicker than normal and fried to a crispy golden brown.  Don't know if they're seasoned but whatever it is they do its damn good!  Each order comes with a your choice of dipping sauces, which is pretty classy if you ask me.  We went with a variety of sauces that included blue cheese & bacon, curry ketchup, pesto mayo, and the tatziki.  Again a great idea because the different sauces allowed you to get a different flavor with each fry.   Overall it was a great experience, and a lot easier than I was expecting. The atmosphere was lively and the sausages were flavorful, priced accordingly, and cooked to perfection.  Now couple that with the OMFG fries and an ice cold Franziskaner like I did this afternoon and you've got yourself a recipe for disaster!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place."},{"date":"2010-10-19","rating":"4.0","review":"I'm not like obsessed with sausage or anything (contrary to what Katie tells me), but if I had to down some sausage, I'd down it at vuuurssshtkurrrshhhuuuh...I like to go exotic, my favorites are the Buffalo and the Rabbit sausages.

I like getting 2 sausages myself one regular and one exotic to mix it up, so I can't really suggest a specific one. There is of course some sausage shrinkage when it gets to your table, so the meat to bun ratio is a little off kilter, more bun than meat, but it can't be helped.

And bonus points for anyone that orders their Spaten Pils in a boot!  FYI There always seem to be lines if you get here during peak hours, I suggest coming by during the week to give it a shot or be prepared to wait."},{"date":"2011-06-01","rating":"5.0","review":"5 Stars because I would want to know about this place and chow down.I went mid-afternoon which seemed like a good time especially since I had never been and had to acclimate to their set up and menu.  You walk into a little entrance room where you decide what kind of sausage set up and beer you would like(you don't have to get beer here, you can get unique sodas or grab a beer inside). Looks like it could get cramped and awkward during busy times and you might not have the time I did to have a Q & A with the young lady behind the register to figure out my best meal.After ordering I took my beer down a hallway to their beer hall area.  A large area with some long tables and small tables, there's a lot of concrete and wood.  There's some patio seating but I never hopped out.My duck and bacon sausage with onions and peppers came with a side of fries.  Sausage was moist and flavorful and the fries were tasty.  I definitely want to come back period but I want to check out some of the more common sausages to give me a better gauge to compare to other sausage.Shame on me, I've gone on this far without mentioning the variety and volume of beers.  There were about 24 on tap and about as many in a bottle.  The majority of beers are Belgian and German with a few others like a cider or PBR just to keep it honest.Cons - The dining area was a bit cold and sterile but again it's more beer hall than candle light dining so be ready to be social.  Also if you want to get more grub once you're in the hall you can't order from the bartenders you have to go back to the little room.  I'm sure they've rationalized doing this but awkward is awkward.Oh yeah there were about 20 different sausages to choose from.  They have standards like Bratwurst to vegetarian selections to Louisiana hot links and rattlesnake.Enjoy your sausage and beer."},{"date":"2011-02-08","rating":"4.0","review":"A solid 3 1/2 stars. 4 stars for the service and 3 stars for the food.Believe it or not, we came here on a Saturday night with a group of 12 including 5 teenagers ranging in age from 13 to 16.

Very cool and well worthy of four stars.The food and beer on the other hand, not bad but not great. My wife had the green chilies and cilantro sausage which was, quite frankly, dry and not very flavorful. I had the buffalo, beef and pork sausage which was good but not so great.

If you are a fan of German beer, this is the place to be!

I haven't really been to a restaurant that specialized in sausages, and drinks, but I have heard and read lots of good things out about this place. So me and a couple of good friends had a farewell dinner for my friend Billy L. First, we joke, \"yeah, you would have picked a sausage place of ALL places!\" lol Environment/AtmosphereThis place is in a pretty decent part of LA, and close to the 101 freeway. Easy to get too, but you can easily get lost if you take the wrong turn, hence, we joked, \"Where can we find the 'worst coochie'?\" HAHA The place looks almost small from the outside, and literally a 'hole in the wall' kinda place. This place looks and feels like a club/bar scene, but with picnic tables on the inside, and a bar. The only thing I'd probably have to complain about is, that it was really dim in there, being that we ate there for dinner 9pm, and it was pretty dark in there. Very clean, and spacious.Food/DrinksSausages. This place has a variety of sausages to choose from, I personally love hot links, so I had the Louisiana Hot Link w/ caramelized onions and spicy pepper. If you sausage on the mind [LOL], this is the place to get your fix. DRINKS, this place has all sorts of alcoholic and non alcoholic beer. I must say, their sodas are not like your average soda, these sodas were some brands I haven't even heard of, and flavors which a lot of people haven't tried yet, [I've had some of the ones they had before] I particularly wanted to try their Vanilla Cream soda. That was the softest drink I have ever tasted, it was pretty damn good. Best cream soda I have ever had. ServiceThis place is very friendly. Being that the line was long to order, one of the servers started going around, and asked if we wanted to get started on something to drink before we even got up to pay for anything. They definitely know their beers, as my friend Peter N. couldn't decide on what kind of beer he would like, so quickly as what kinda beer he liked? flavor preferred? etc. And just like that, he called his pals behind the counter for the drinks and we got them right away! They are pretty fast as well, I didn't find myself waiting any longer than 5-10mins for my food. Great service!!!OVERALLThis place is just amazing, inside and out, and the food is tasty! Again, the only thing I would have to say about this place is how dim it is in there during the dinner hours, but other than that, I would definitely recommend this place, and possibly take a second trip out just to have some."},{"date":"2010-05-11","rating":"4.0","review":"Why wouldn't I like a place with a crazy arse name, a line out the door and bouncers - for sausage!?Randomly dragged out by a relative in some random spot of Los Angeles with some of the worst parking ever for a corner location restaurant that is super duper hip with solid sausage fare.It was a Friday night so of course it was going to be busy.  So watch out by 7:30 pm and on you are going to be in one heck of a line.  But don't fear, these folks move pretty quick and once you walk in, they'll offer you the chance to get your drink as you wait to order.  They have RANDOM sausages like rattlesnake, filipino sausage and rabbit.  PLUS they have veggie sausage - yes totally random.  You walk up, you see the sausage in a glass refrigerated case and then you take the rich smells of sausage in as they are grilled before your eyes.  You walk down a narrow brick hallway and TA DA - there is a BUSY BUSY BUSY group of folks huddled around heavy wood tables where you just kinda sit where you can.  And who knew?  There's a DJ too!Oh yes the food.  Soft springy bread encases the sausages and several kinds of mustard are offered on the tables for your enjoyment.  I had the Filipino sausage and it was good - it's a sweet flavor so don't be surprised on that.Oh my goodness, the fries.  Thick cut and greasy, but um the BLEU CHEESE dip IS FRIGGGGGGGIN FANTASTIC.  CHUNKY BUT too little of a serving.  I think if I ever go back, I'll PAY for like 10 of them it was that good."},{"date":"2011-02-02","rating":"4.0","review":"I'm another fan of the Rattlesnake/Rabbit/Jalapeno sausage.

Very smoky (which for me... smokier is better) and just a touch of spicyness. Got the large order of fries which I split with a buddy. Fries were good but not great. Didn't order any beer since I'm not a big drinker and my buddy had to go back to work.The only drawback is the price.

My obsession for what I consider the menu combination equivalent of Aryanism (\"perfect\", per German guidelines) has led me to many different, common-tabled establishments and events, including München's Oktoberfest.

YUM! You are compelled to top your sausage selection off with Belgian Fries, which are crispy and delicious! With the small orders you get to chose one dipping sauce and the large allows you two, of which I favor the pesto mayo and have enjoyed the curry ketchup and the bleu cheese walnut and bacon.The beer selection features an array of Belgian and German brews, generally heavy in alcohol content, that will easily satisfy a wide spectrum of drinkers.This place is hip and small, keep that in mind when you go here. You will wait, you will likely have to wait for a seat to open up, but don't be shy, make a new friend! The sausage and beer are worth coming out for the LA-stylized, Bavarian \"hall\" is a quaint and cool venue to enjoy your beer and neighbors, too.Hint: DO NOT come with a large group, anything more than four will likely leave you not seeing each other much throughout the evening.

While their brats and kielbasa may be good, where else can you find buffalo or rattlesnake sausages. So, it ended being a toss up between the Buffalo or the Rattlesnake & Rabbit. Rattlesnake and Rabbit eventually won out because the natural animosity between the two animals would never have them team up in the wild. The sausage was good, perhaps not as moist as I hoped, but this is probably due to to the leanness of both rattlesnake and rabbit. There's just not much fat in either animal.The Ginger Beer (nonalcoholic) that I drank was gingery - more so than ginger ale. If you have brewed ginger tea for sore throats before, imagine a cold, bubbly version.The ambiance is a typical laid back bar/restaurant with some outdoor seating. The music and noise level was fairly loud, but no so loud that I felt that I had to scream at my friends seating on the other side of the table.

Definitely recommend :)"},{"date":"2012-08-24","rating":"5.0","review":"My husband and I decided to try this place for lunch since we'd never been before and love trying new places.  The line to order was a good sign that this place was good.  We ordered a Bratwurst and the Austin blue sausages, with the fries that had the truffle glaze on them.  Wow! Those fries with the glaze were a-maz-ing!  You get 2 dipping sauces with a large fries, so we chose the bacon, blue cheese, and walnut dip and the curry ketchup.  Both were so good I wish I had more.  And the beer...and my husband and I, you could say we are beer snobs!...what a great selection!  I had La Chouffe...sounds like a cutesy girl's beer...but at 8% and after drinking 2...that is no cutesy girl's beer!  So glad we tried this place, and we can't wait to go again!"},{"date":"2010-03-24","rating":"5.0","review":"FYI it's pronounced- \"Vurst-ku-khey\"....unless you want to be a dumbass like me and walk around saying Wurst Kooch. I was in the mood for a delectable, juicy, spicy dog....and I wasn't going to let the fact that I'm vegetarian stand in the way. I've been reading about this place a lot...I mean 1,000+ reviews in LA is almost unheard of so I knew it was going to be an experience. My guy and I showed up around 7p.m. on a Friday night. It's in a totally obscure part of downtown and a little difficult to find at first. Parking is a biiiyatch so be prepared for that. We drove in circles a few times and got lucky enough to find a meter across the street. It's in the Arts District so the area is filled with hipster/artsy types. We got there just in time because right after we got in the line to order it grew about a block out the door. My guy and I ordered the following:Veggie Italian w/ Carmelized Onions and Sweet Peppers ($6)Veggie Italian w/ Carmelized Onions and Spicy Peppers ($6)Large Fries w/ White Truffle Oil and a side of Chipotle Aioli and Buttermilk Ranch ($7.00)Chimay White (Belgian Beer -$8)Reissdorf Kolsch (German Beer- $7.50)Shneider Brooklyner Hopfen Weisse (German Beer- $11)Gruner Veltliner (Austrian White Wine- $8)Total bill after tax and tip: $70The Veggie Italian Dogs were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. I've been veg for about a year and a half now and this is the best I've had so far. There's a slew of different mustards you can try with your dog- spicy, sweet or the standard yellow. My fav was the spicy mustard. The carmelized onions and sweet peppers were such a tasty, flavorful and juicy way to top off the dog. My guy preferred the spicy peppers on his. The Veg Italian Dog has a nice kick to it and lots of great flavor. The fries- ohhhhh the fries- they were so, SO crazy good. Just a warning- the white truffle oil will make you cream your pants it's so effin good. You get 2 choices for dipping sauce with your fries- we got Chipotle Aioli and Buttermilk Ranch. The Ranch was decent, but the Aioli beat it by far.You seat yourself at this place and it was pretty packed on the Friday night we were there so I would recommend getting there early!! It was gorgeous outside and we got lucky enough to snag one of the few tables on their patio so that was lovely. Getting drunk and eating hot dogs....what a perfect night =)"},{"date":"2012-07-25","rating":"5.0","review":"Clearly this establishment doesn't need another glowing review to add to their 3000+, but tough sh*t - here is mine. After hearing numerous recommendations and enduring countless retellings of unmatchable vibe, bountiful beer selection, and sausages made of rattlesnake and rabbit, I finally had the occasion to visit Wurstküche in downtown LA last week for a birthday gathering. I am happy to say that all the hysterical ravings were indeed founded. And come on, if there's one thing I know it's where to find a good wiener. ;-) For starters, the neighborhood is unexpectedly awesome. Wurstkuche is just one of a handful of trendy bars and fun little eateries that are strewn amongst the brand new apartment complexes and converted warehouse lofts. We arrived at 830 on a Sunday night to find a line out the door. Some people would be irritated, but to the starving artist, a waiting line is always a good thing. If people are willing to stand in line for food, then it's gotta be pretty damn special. Also I kind of enjoy standing in line and getting the vibe of the place and of the people in line. Also reading the menu.The big draw to this place is their house made sausages that range from the classic bratwurst to crazy exotic flavors like rattlesnake, rabbit, and jalapeno peppers. The rattlesnake is the most talked about creation, hailed for its buttery texture and maddening flavor. I went for the duck, bacon, and jalapeno and was totally blown away.... ok, confession: I got two. The duck and the kielbasa. I love me some kielbasa and this was by far one of the best I've had. They even have vegetarian sausages so you can easily convince your hipster tree-loving friends to come with you - clearly they know their audience.  Their rolls are fresh baked and grilled along with the sausages. Even their mustards and dipping sauces are all house-made. I'm not one to sh*t myself over french fries like many of my friends are, but I have to say the fries at this place are defffinitely worth soiling oneself over. Fresh, thick cut, crispy outside, soft inside. I ate way more than I care to admit. And don't think you're just dipping them in ketchup - try curry ketchup, chipotle aioli, zesty bbq, or blue cheese walnut & bacon just to name a few. As if the fries aren't addictive enough, the sauces make it culinary heroin.For non-drinkers like me, they have an exceptional selection of gourmet sodas to go alongside their ridiculously huge beer selection. I generally don't purchase or drink soda. Habit I got out of years ago. Gourmet soda, however, had me intrigued, and since I'm at this new place eating duck sausages, I thought what the hell, let's get a fancy soda. I went for Fentiman's Ginger Beer. Spicy and delicious.Now this night I was in the mood to splurge a bit - it was my friend's birthday so I went for it. I wound up spending $26. Normally I wouldn't even consider spending $5 for a bottle of soda, nor would I purchase french fries for just myself (I bought an order to share with my friends.... and then ate the majority of them...). I definitely plan to return to eat rattlesnake and when I do, I know I will be just fine with only one sausage and perhaps a small order of fries. But, if you're looking to splurge, this is definitely the place to get serious bang for your buck. And honestly the atmosphere just puts it over the top. We sat outside, which I loved, but their inside seating with a full bar is gorgeous. Chill and diverse clientele, it's a great place to hang and have a good time. Definitely the kind of place to bring a group of friends, but if you're in the mood for good sausage, who cares - go for it. I also love the friendly staff who talk to you while you're in line and will bring you beer while you wait. Not too shabby.Bottom line: go to Wurstkuche. Right now. A heavenly sausage experience awaits you."},{"date":"2014-03-06","rating":"4.0","review":"Great selection of sausages, and even though I'm not big on German/Belgian beers, theirs are delicious."},{"date":"2013-01-02","rating":"5.0","review":"This place is great.

Not the nicest of neighborhoods to be at night if you were alone, however a group of hungry carnivores standing in line made the wait less stressful. After a 30minute wait in line in front of hungry smokers and my lungs were choking with each cigarette they lit up (apporx 3,290 or so it seems). I like the smell of smoke on salmon, ribs or bbq, but when you have to endure 30mins of that, it felt like my constant bid to stay health was rapidly going down the drain. Anyway back to the food, Belgian fries - good. Snake Sausage - good. Mozzarella and sun-dried tomatoes - WTF?? This was wicked awesome!! Belgian fries were delicious, if feeling were used to describe this it would be of teeth chattering cobble of the Ronde van Vlaanderen. That's how explosive it was. The Spicy BBQ was a let down. The snake sausage was good, but it lacked a bit of Oomph. It was pedestrian at best. The Moz + SDT was a freaking surprise, what wonderful + blissful combination. It's like eating a pizza with the ease of a bun. What's there not to like? A bunch of random meats and spices stuffed into the intestines of a pig? Best invention since the invention of sausage. What ever that means, i don't know. Crap I'm hungry again. Price - ??? Hmm... not a fan ... stick gourmet in front of anything and you can charge a pretty decent premium.

Props to trying new things with it and, in most cases, succeeding.I got the rattlesnake and rabbit and was able to try the mango one (not sure what it was called.) The taste is unique with a sharp spice. It also has a more rubbery texture and coloring. Awesome for trying new things and enjoying the outcome. Not that i'm saying I enjoy eating rubber, it's just, you know...anyways.The crowds can get intense, and the lay out of the seating area is 3 long tables surrounded by smaller tables. We had to squeeze in between crowds, an interesting experience, but i'm not much of a in-the-crowds person.  There is outdoor eating, so that may not have been a bad decision to make. Will be back again soon, just gotta mind those lines and crowds.

The beer of course was excellent, however I highly recommend going with a German draft rather than the bottled beer I picked up (it was a good beer though).What prevented this place from getting 5 stars was the portions and the price...the sausage was 7.50, and though the quality was great it didn't fill me up.

That's cool.\"What is it that makes meat products in tube form so agreeable? Much had been made of Wurstküche, the \"purveyor of exotic grilled sausages\", before a couple guests and I ambled around South Hewitt and 3rd asking each other, \"Are we at the right place?\" Indeed we were, and I'm happy to say Wurstküche lived up to the hype. Between three people, we had the Vegetarian Italian (fennel, garlic, red peppers, and eggplant), Louisiana Hot Link (beef, pork, onions, and hot spices), Green Chillies & Cilantro (you'll never guess what's in it aside from chicken and turkey), and my pick, the Rattlesnake + Rabbit with Jalapeño. Each sausage is topped with two of the following: caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, or spicy peppers (I had sauerkraut and spicy peppers on my Rattlesnake + Rabbit), and there's an assortment of self-serve mustards to garnish your sausage with. We also shared a \"groot\", or large fry, dipping them into Sweet and Sassy BBQ and Chipotle Ketchup.While the Louisiana Hot Link emerged as my favorite, each sausage was unique and flavorful (although I didn't try the Vegetarian). In the aptly named Green Chillies + Cilantro, the highlighted ingredients each stood out and created a beautiful balance of soothing heat; the Louisiana Hot Link was bold and spicy; the Rattlesnake & Rabbit was mildly gamey -- in a pleasant way -- and a worthwhile gamble. The sausage toppings were wonderful, and although the fries were just okay, the dipping sauces were great.\"Next time you swing through, we'll go embarrass ourselves like we did at Mozza,\" texted my friend, referring to the time we tried to eat five pizzas at Pizzeria Mozza by ourselves.

Wurstkuche is LA at its best... it is a concept restaurant/bar that takes a trend and makes it modern. In this case, beer and brats. The staple at a festival or street fair on the East Coast has now gone classy at Wurstkuche. Wurstkuche looks like an art gallery, recording studio, and the loft apartment you've always dreamed of; rolled into one with an added bar and sausage grill. The beer selection is extensive, especially the Belgian beer which makes me happy. I ordered the Rabbit Sausage which I found to be very light, with a hint of sweetness, but also needed more flavor. This could have helped with the spicy peppers and caramelized onions I ordered, but they were cold. My boyfriend had the Duck and Bacon Sausage which had strong flavor with a mix of the duck and gooey bacon flavor. I should have ordered that... However, he ordered spicy peppers and sweet onions and yet, they messed up his order and gave him my toppings, as well. The fries were filling; but there were too many overly crispy/burnt pieces. But they were delicious with the curry ketchup we chose and the table-side spicy mustard and deli mustard. Overall, Wurstkuche is a great concept in an artsy environment.

Last weekend my friends and I decided to pop in there on our way home from another bar at around 1:30.  We were in luck.  They had not made last call yet.  We grabbed beers and sat at one of the tables.  Within 15 minutes a huge bouncer walked over to our table and told us that we were being too loud and would need to keep it down.  This would not upset me if I was in a restaurant or a library, but this is a beer hall!  The kitchens were closed, our group comprised 6 of the only 20 or so patrons in the place, and the music was so loud it was difficult not to shout over it.  I told him that if he could turn the music down I wouldn't have to yell over it to have a conversation with my friends.  He said that the music would be off when they close.  He left and then they gave last call.  When one of my friends got up to get his last beer for the evening he was told that the beer he wanted wasn't served at last call.  Then I looked up to see someone claiming to be the owner telling one of my other friends to keep it down again.  That was it.  I left a half a beer on the table and got up to get my check.  As I was doing so the so called owner whom I had never seen there before was in my face trying to explain himself.  I didn't want to hear it so I gave him the finger signed my bill and walked out.  I waited a few days to cool off before posting this.  Looking back I will admit and never did deny that we were being fairly loud, but that big of a place with only a few people in it has a lot of reverb which coupled with a dj pumping music creates a soup of noise that is hard to talk over.  Thus creating a vicious cycle.  That I understand.  What I don't understand is how you can tell customers in a beer hall complete with crate paper covered community tables and loud thumping music to keep their voices down.  For that I will not go back.  Its a shame too because I love the rattle snake and rabbit sausage.-Nate"},{"date":"2010-02-03","rating":"4.0","review":"The only thing that I am going to do tonight is:1) Write this review and 2) Turn on the TV, probably to find '2 and a Half Men' is the only thing that is getting good reception, and then watch it though it's the worst show of all timeThe reason I bring up this is because these are the last two things I SHOULD be doing. Currently there is about 500 lbs of clothes that are drenched in water, water that slipped through the cracks of my upstairs neighbor's floor from her leaky water heater down through my roof and into my closet. Every time I inhale I am inhaling the sweet scent of a musty apartment, dampened from the last three days of consistent dripping, slowing forming into mold and probably threatening my health and sanity. Why do I do these things? Here I am with an obvious amount of work to undertake before I retire tonight, yet I tickity-tap away on review number 145 for what? So that I can then spend an additional 30 minutes tomorrow logging on to see if anyone UFC'd it? What the fuck is the point of all this?And before I delve deeper into my existential rant about the point of ANY of this, let me take a few seconds and say:Wurstküche:- Totally awesome- Exceeded my expectations- The back area is totally rad- The ambiance is really impressive- The sausage will leave you smiling- Outside area?

I am drafting this review as I am sitting on the cafeteria lunch tables in the restaurant. Anyway, it's my roommate's 21st birthday. Happy birthday to Mr. Park tonight. Haha.The sausages are plentiful here. And there's quite a variety. The tough part is deciding which one to get. And not knowing if it's going to be good (yea, I know I should have checked the reviews for recommendations before I ordered). Ordered the Austin Blues spicy sausage and the fries. That particular sausage wasn't anything to write home about. But my companions definitely enjoyed their respective orders (including rattlesnake).  The fries were cooked well too. The variety of sauces does help.  Gotta respect the beer availabilty as well. I would highly recommend the spaten optimator. Smooth and chocolatey.It's hard to hear your friends inside with the roaring crowd and club music blaring.

Even when it appears impossible you will ever find a place to sit or get your food in time, miraculously, you do. Wurstkuche (\"sausage kitchen\" for you non-German speakers) is tucked way out in the Arts District of LA. Somewhere on the border of the Warehouse District, Little Tokyo, and Skid Row. The first time I went it took me 10 minutes longer than necessary to find it. But when you do, come with an appetite for exotic sausages and truly the best Belgian french fries in LA. (That's right, I said it). When you have have a choice of more than 8 dipping sauces to dunk your fries in, life can be pretty good. This night we tried the chipotle ketchup, curry ketchup, Thai peanut, chipotle aoili, and blue cheese walnut. The last one was too chunky and a bit flavorless, but the others were lip smacking delish.And you have a delightful and difficult zoo of choices when it comes to the sausages....buffalo, alligator, pork, duck, rattlesnake, rabbit...and some traditional options such as kielbasa, spicy Italian, bratwurst, chicken apple, and others. There's even vegetarian options for you non-zoo folks (I've never understood this, but I'm cool with your decision to protect furry creatures). I'm partial to the buffalo chipotle sausage...smoky and salty. I order mine with grilled onions and drown it in yellow mustard for that extra heartburn effect. No worries, as you have about 65 European brews to cool the belly. I studied briefly in Scotland, so I always go for the cider. This is a great spot to meet new friends, introduce old ones to a cool concept, and socialize with the locals. Great vibe, fun, close to Little Tokyo and will not disappoint."},{"date":"2012-07-22","rating":"4.0","review":"Came here on a Saturday night so of course there was a long line but it moved surprisingly fast.

I assumed to a place in Little Tokyo, but found myself walking into the Artist District. I've never been here before, but herd about it on multiple occasions. We entered into the seating area and the first thing I saw was the bar. Cool I thought. Ultra cool picnic tables were the seating of choice. I was then led to the back hallway and to the counter. On a Tuesday lunch-time there was a line out the door. I perused the menu and was amazed at the variety of sausages that were available. I mean they have everything that you can think of. I decided on sun-dried tomato & mozzarella chicken/turkey sausage with sweet onions and hot peppers. For a better bang-for-your-buck we all ordered a round of the Optimizer (@ 9% ABV for 6.50 ~ Heck yes!). All I could say was DELICIOUS DELICIOUS DELICIOUS! I was full after the beer and sausage and doing the little foody dance after every bite.

I love the fries and their sauces. I like my fries with the curry ketchup. One of these days I'll muster up the guts to try their more exotic sausages like the rattlesnake and rabbit with jalapenos. Will report back when I do. The restaurant is very chic but it's definitely not a place where you can have a conversation. It's loud, the seats are uncomfortable and the parking isn't the greatest.

Rattlesnake Rabbit is a great starting point for anyone going here. Pair it up with a nice Kostritzer and you've got yourself a hearty friggin' meal. The Chicken and Apple is delicious if you have a sweet tooth (pair that up with the strawberry beer) and the spicy Italian is good if you like your food hot (though IMO it's not ALL that spicy).Don't get me wrong I love this place and the food is tasty, perhaps tastier than tasty. But I just choose to not go around much because it can get quite inconvenient. The brats are delicious, always cooked well, and the toppings are great. But sometimes it can be way too much and the roll gets soggy quick (I like a soft, crunchy bread roll). It gets three stars because if you go at a peak time you are at least looking at a good 15 minutes in line. With another 15 to get your food with another 10 to get a seat (if you're lucky). Seriously, the place could be twice as big and would probably still be packed. The food is delicious. I crave it every now and then, but I hate the wait and I hate having to hover over others while they are enjoying their meal.

The DJ thing is pretty cool. As for the sausages themselves, I think this place is worth at least one try. They have unique sausages with different varieties of meat and flavorings....My friend and I each had two different sausages and an order of fries with truffle oil, I got to taste all 4. They were all pretty tasty, as were the fries (though I don't know if the extra cost for the truffle oil is worth it...) However I have to say I favor Portillo's in terms of taste.

However, if the description wasn't on the menu, I'd think I was just eating a typical hotlink sausage~the crocodile doesn't really make much of a difference in taste. The belgian fries are thickly cut and crisp. Curry ketchup really tastes like curry and the chipotle aioli is pretty good.

Which I think kind of sucks, but in L.A., a lot of food is sold on price rather than taste, so yeah. I got the hot italian sausage with sweet peppers. The peppers were not completely cooked, but I liked that. I wished they were sliced a little thinner, but I worked with it. The sausage was good. I've had better italian sausage, but I like the slight heat in this. The bun tasted good, but I found it sort of rough. My friend got the veggie version of the sausage with caramelized onions... or almost cooked onions in this case. The fries, or whatever they call them, are great. The dipping sides of chipotle ketchup (good) and tomato/mayo (amazing) are a pleasant surprise.

I came by myself for lunch and decided to order another sausage after finishing the first one. I had to walk to the other room where they take the order (wait in line...again...of course). When I came back, my seat was taken (of course) and there are no other seats available (inside and outside). Other people were looking for seats too so I decided to eat in my car. Standing around, holding my number, and waiting for the order to come out was uncomfortable. There should be a better system!!!!!!!- they take the order in one room and the dining area is in another.

Once you get it, there's a cornucopia of sausages to choose from in a case right in front of the grill. Since it was my first time, I opted for something safe, the keilbasa. Wow! What an amazing choice. The sausage had amazing flavor but most importantly, had great snap. A hot dog or sausage is nothing if it doesn't snap. To accompany my keilbasa, I ordered their famous fries and a Delirium Tremens. Wow, it was perfect!

She was super rushed and rude. She was acting like she knew everything and rushed us along, but got our order wrong. All the hipster people working there kinda looked like they feared her. She was training a guy and he and I locked eyes and had a complete conversation in our eyes, like wtf is up with this lady? She crazy!!! I'm sorry you have to work for her!

The hot dogs and beer selection is good, but it's a little overpriced and there is one line to order the dogs and a separate line for the beer. You even have to wait in line for water. After all that, then you have to figure out where you're going to sit. All this for a hot dog? You can argue that you have to wait 2 hours for a Pinks hot dog, but at least I'm just standing still, not worrying about  the separate beer line and if I can find seating after.

Where else can you get rattlesnake and rabbit or duck and bacon or buffalo sausages? Who doesn't want to try some exotic meats? I had the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage. My justification was that if I was only going to eat one I was going to have the oddest combination possible.  Verdict? It tasted like...a sausage. I mean if no one told me what it was, I don't think I would have guessed. It was lighter than beef and similar to pork or turkey. It was still quite delicious if a little greasy. The caramelized onions were yum but the sauerkraut was only so-so, I've had better. I think the worst thing was the bread. It was stale and bland and stuck to my mouth. Perhaps they make it this way so you have to consume large amounts of beer to wash it down with. Speaking of beer, they have a lot of it. This is the real redeeming quality of this place. A large and unusual selection of beers on tap and bottled as well as plenty of interesting non-alcoholic drinks. They even put cucumbers in the free (presumably tap) water they leave out for everyone. The space is pretty nice too. You order up front and it looks tiny but then you walk down a long hallway and get to a large room with long tables covered in brown paper as well as a large bar. Plenty of seating though I heard this place is crazy full at lunch on weekdays. Overall I enjoyed the experience and I'd probably come back to try another exotic sausage and perhaps the fries. I think the best thing to do is just order two and take them out of the stale bun and just eat the meat. That would have improved things significantly. The beer selection and the fun of eating weird animals makes up for the crap bread and hipster patrons (it is in the \"Arts District\" after all).  Wish it wasn't all the way downtown with all of the \"fun\" finding parking in that area."},{"date":"2010-03-23","rating":"3.0","review":"WOULD DEFINITELY RETURN to sample more. had the the rabbit with veal, pork & white wine sausage and the vegetarian Italian, not bad, but they weren't good enough to die for :P.

I got the Rabbit, Veal and Pork sausage with sauerkraut and carmelized onions. The sauerkraut was not overly sour to cover the taste of the sausage and the bun everything was placed in was soft and moist. I drank a Koning Hoevner Trappist beer but I should have paired a slightly less alcoholic beer because my sausage was very light and not dense at all.The environment was great for eating and was kind to adults and children alike. The interior had an awesome rustic feel of butcher paper-covered tables and bare ceiling rafters, while being super chic and modern with their DJ booth in the corner playing music from the Apple laptop. Very good environment to eat in with little to no pomp but plenty of pizazz.People should go and enjoy, just don't go when I do so I don't have to wait in line much longer, ok?UPDATE: Thanks to an observant reader I was informed the prices of some beers I mentioned earlier were the way they are because of the amount of alcohol served. There is a 3 LITER bottle for $95 and a 6L bottle for $250, both over 8.5 ABV! Thanks for the correction and now that section has been deleted for inaccuracy.

You could also eat outside as well. Luckily it was not crowded so there was enough room to sit on the tables. The tables are covered with butcher paper, which you can tell they do not change it out often because you can see the previous food stains. I happen to be a messy eater, so I'm sorry to whoever sat where I sat and saw all my dropped onion stain markings haha. :p They also have a bar with a huge selection of beers.

Sooo good!!! 100xs better than the safe sausages! Didn't know rattle snakes tasted so good!Pros:- Good variety of sausages- Good variety of beer- MUST get the Rattle Snake sausage- MUST get their fries WITH dipping saucesCons:- If its your first time, the ordering process might be confusing.- Line can be long, but goes by pretty fast- When it gets crowded it can be hard to find seats- Street parking"},{"date":"2010-01-12","rating":"2.0","review":"My sister told me about this place......... so i should've known, it would be a feeding hole ( Spelled Hole incorrectly last time - Thanks Benito for catching that) for Hipsters...!!!When i heard that Little Tokyo's Art Loft District housed a hole in the wall Gourmet Sausage joint that served imported beers I automatically thought of an old German-style Deli.When we got there.... I was surprised, the order area was awesome, the raw sausages were all on display, and so were the beverages. The only thing that wasn't on display was a menu (but they had paper menus for you to grab).Ok so i order the Rattlesnake and Rabbit sausage with grilled onions and sweet peppers, a large serving of Belgium fries with Curry mustard, and BBQ sauce, and a large bottle water. This totaled $18+.WOW...!!! sausage fries and a drink combo for $20...??????? Ok so if i dont develop an immunity for poisonous rattlesnake venom, then i want my money back...!!!We order then walk down this hallway and end up in this back room (dining room). It was dark, with side tables and long picnic tables down the middle. In the back theres a bar and an exit.No joke it looked like a Glendale Hookah bar that smelled like Mustard, ketchup and beer, and filled with less interesting people.I mean there were men with Beards wearing spandex pants. Almost every guy there had a plaid shirt on, and looked like a colorful dirty trucker.There were a few women there, but they looked just as lost as i was.As much as i love sausage i dont think i can bring myself to come back here. I thought the parking sucks, the workers were wack, the food was ok, and the ambiance was garbage.

Service sucked.  I didn't even really mind the line because you can order beer while waiting, but after we had ordered, we went to go sit.  Then a few minutes later, the cashier came running to us saying that they lost our ticket and needed our order again.  So, we told him.  THEN, we got our sausages and they forgot my sauerkraut, the one thing I was really looking forward to!!  THEN, they forgot our fries!  I had to go back there and ask for our fries.  The waitress didn't even seem phased and got us the fries, which makes me think that this happens all the time.  However, the atmosphere is super cool, very German cafeteria style.  I'd definitely go back...despite the service. ;)"},{"date":"2010-08-11","rating":"4.0","review":"OK.I've been able to get in here twice since my initial review and all I have to say is I LOVE BEER especially when it's served in tall glasses by friendly bartenders and I REALLY LOVE KCRW discounts."},{"date":"2011-03-18","rating":"4.0","review":"Really good sausage and beer!  And a fun atmosphere!I went to Wurstkuche on a Saturday night and the place was SLAMMED.  I arrived at what I thought was an early enough time to beat the crowd: 7:30 p.m.  When I arrived, there was already a line out the door.  I didn't realize that you order at the front counter, then head back to the rear room which is filled with picnic tables.  The picnic table set up is really conducive to socializing with the people sitting around you.  It was a lot of fun and a great way to get to know people (and talk about their sausages!). I had the bratwurst and fries with toppings and dipping sauce.  Wurstkuche has about 30 different sauces and toppings to choose from for your sausage and fries.  The sauces are really interesting and are far different from your standard ketchup and mustard.   The prices were reasonable for both the sausages and the beer (they have a large beer selection).  The only thing that prevents me from giving this place five stars is the fact that it was really busy and it was a little hard to find a table.  Other than that, I thought the food was good, and more importantly, it was a great experience.  Definitely something to see!"},{"date":"2012-02-26","rating":"4.0","review":"this place doesn't need anymore reviews but oh well i started typing...booooooooooze, they have quite the Belgium and German Beer selection to tickle your fancy. goes very well with the soda and brat choices.

So I sauntered down to this place, which was happily empty just prior to the lunch rush I'm sure.Went thru the bar to the order area, actually told my little yearning story to the cashier and oddly enough she said she wakes up like that everyday. Which I thought deserves some kind of comment but since I could just have easily messed it up, decided discretion the better part of parlor (i don't believe in valor)She took my order with a beaming smile and happy face, made a suggestion which i heartily agreed with, kraut and onion, went to the table I was the sole user of.Got my lunch with courtesy and politeness.Took a gulp of water, put mustard on that sucker, had a few fries (fucking awesome!)then dug into my penii like meat thingy with the dexterity of a gymnast on the balance beam.chomping and swallowing and choreographed switching 'tween fries and brat to water then napkin then back again.A better  lunch could not have been achieved unless the cashier girl was sitting with me telling me the story of how she got lost in London once when she was a little girl.Going to go back there and have the beers next.OH and a heads up about that parking problem.

The ambiance was totally worth the line, the wait, and the 10 dollar hotdog. They delivered to our table and we had a mighty fine meal.The belgian fries could be way better- they were a little too burned for our batch, and we're used to yellow belgian fries rather than brown.But still- delicious!When we left there was a bouncer on the side exit wishing us goodbye.

Major drawbacks: it was really crowded, we went at 8 on a Friday night, and seating took a little while to find. More than that though, the bill for two sausages, a thing of fries, and two beers was $40. Whoa Nelly.

I must say that I didn't find much of a difference between it and a normal pork sausage as far as taste goes, but now I can say that I have tried alligator! I am a bit dismayed with the \"exotic\" sausage selection available as most of them seem to have jalapeños or some sort of hot peppers which I just can't eat because I'm a wuss. The sausage also comes with a few different topping options such as sauerkraut or onion.On top of sausage, Wurstkuche also has some amazing French fries that come with great dipping sauces as well as some great beers.

They all come in different sizes/amounts though so make sure you check the serving size before your order! Definitely a cool place to hang out with friends and grab a late night sausage ;)I wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars for the atmosphere, but I'm going with a three just because the sausages were alright tasting, but not like I'm gonna empty my wallet right now and buy the whole lot of them tasty."},{"date":"2010-02-22","rating":"2.0","review":"Been there a couple of times now.

It's a very popular spot.We tried the kielbasa; the alligator & pork andouille; the rattlesnake and rabbit with jalapeno peppers; the rabbit, veal and pork with white wine; the chicken, apples & spices; and the marharlika filipino (sweet pork and natural seasonings).The sausages come in a fresh roll and they offer toppings such as sweet peppers, sauerkraut, etc. They also have a selection of mustards and horseradish, etc. Their spicy brown mustard is very good, as is the sauerkraut. The fries are OK. The dipping sauces are better than the fries themselves.The prices range from 6.50 to 7.75 per sausage. The service is friendly.What can I say though? Meh. The sausages were all pretty much interchangeable and bland. Only the Filipino Marharlika had any real flavor to it, I'm sorry to say. I've had better sausage sandwiches at the ArcLight!The place is kinda neat. Long wooden tables and a bar. But it's all so pretentious and full of rich kid wannabe-artist types--it's in the \"arts\" district after all--you know, insufferable HIPSTERS! I felt guilty going there.

While the rattlesnake and alligator sausages do not sound that appealing at first glance, keep in mind that the sausages are largely supplemented with other, more \"safe\" meats. I found the exotic ones to actually be some of the most delicious.I also enjoy the Bratwurst and Louisiana Hot Link, but found the Mango Jalapeno to be too sweet. The fries are quite delicious as well, and come with two dipping sauces of your choice. Try the white truffle oil - it's a fairly subtle flavor, but it works well.The ice cream sandwich is meh.

Is it really worth $7? I won't know until I try it for myself, right? I never had rabbit, rattlesnake, alligator, etc so let's give it a shot. I don't remember exactly what I had ordered but they all seem to taste the same. It's just a wiener stuck in between buns. It's not the best, just par.  What I do know is that I love the atmosphere. I think this is the only reason why I keep coming back. It's loud inside when it's over crowded with hungry people. People are walking back and forth ordering more and more, which makes me want to order more. There's a bar in the dining area so you can order drinks there.

Good luck finding it. We were fortunate enough to find someone leaving right in front of the restaurant but prior to that our prospects were looking grim.There was a line out the door and apparently that is not even their busy time. James greeted us at the door and was fabulous, he introduced himself, and explained to us how we order, what he reccommened and how Wurstkuche works. Great first impression.We ordered the Rattlesnake & Rabbit sausage and the Buffalo with the large fries with truffle oil and a cider to wash it down.We then headed to the seating area. What a challenge. The idea is fun and community oriented but difficult to find anywhere to sit on a busy night. We finally found an open area but it was reserved. Now sure that's it cool to reserve seating in a busy restaurant when there is not enough seating to begin with.The seating is cateteria style with long tables down the middle and smaller tables around the edges. We were able to share a table with some people which was gracious of them.The room is dimmly  lite so the waitresses serving really have a challenge trying to find you, because it's hard to see the numbers. Overall the atmosphere was a lot of fun. Great place to go for a fun chill college atmosphere experience. The best part was people were there in all age ranges, 18-65.

I had done my research, looked over the menu online and read all the hype about Wurstküche. And when the time came to finally go, I was, frankly, STOKED! Like, totally dude.Well. Finding parking was a bit of a hassle, but I eventually found a spot 3 blocks away. And not far from that was where the line to get in began! (I exaggerate a bit) It took 30+ minutes to get in the door, and another 15 minutes to actually get to the cashier to place my order. It's okay, I thought to myself, because I was on the verge of having the sausage experience of my life!My friends and I ordered the rattlesnake/jalapeno, alligator, and rabbit Würste, some beers and a some Belgian fries and headed to the back to grab a place to sit. Well, it was 8pm on a Friday and the place was STANDING ROOM ONLY... W. T. EFF. We snuck through to the outdoor \"patio\" which had a few spaces where a person could cram in on the bench along the wall. Eventually, a group got up and left and I was lucky enough to pounce upon their newly-vacated spot! The food was soon brought out to us, and I once again got super excited to eat such exotic food!Well, here goes! Bite into the rattlesnake sausage, and.... it tasted... exactly like any regular old pork sausage! The texture wasn't anything new, and the flavor came almost entirely from the jalapeno. I'm clearly not a sausage connoisseur (heh heh), and what did I expect rattlesnake to taste like anyway? Oh well. The rabbit and the alligator were similar. They tasted far more just like sausage than like their respective animal.The bright spot goes to the Belgian fries. \"Belgian fries\" means \"double fried\" and so extra crispy! Yum! (Of course it can't compare to actual fries in Belgium, but it's way better than the soggy mess they serve at In-N-Out or Wendy's. Not to mention all the interesting and delicious dipping sauces they offer with their fries! Hell, skip the Wurst part of the meal (pun intended - BOOYAH!) and just fill up on fries and sauces!The only issue I have with Wurstküche is that it's marketing itself as such a chic upscale gourmet bar/grill when it's all just a glorified hot dog stand. This kind of food should be served from a small shack (Tommy's anyone?) or food cart or--gasp--food truck!, not in what looks like an art gallery.Will I return to Wurstküche? Perhaps, but not anytime soon. The food was delicious, but the wait was excruciating and the atmosphere pervasively pretentious.

There is a huge selection of unique meat combinations such as rattlesnake and rabbit and other delectable treats.My wife went with the \"Mango Jalapeno\" sausage with caramelized onions and sweet peppers and I treated myself to \"Duck and Bacon\" sausage with the same toppings and an \"Alligator and Pork Andouille\" sausage topped with sauerkraut. Also, we go ourselves a basket of fries.The sausages: They were awesome. Juicy, tender, with a beautiful snap when you bite into one. The mango jalapeno was sweet and lightly spiced while the duck and bacon was beautifully combined to create a smokey and flavorful taste. The alligator and por andouille had an intoxicating smokey-ness to it that we both loved.The price is a bit high, but well worth it. The restaurant and the decor is beautiful and modern with awesome seating for big parties.The beer and soda pop selection were excellent too.

I asked the gentleman behind the counter what he would recommend for a first-timer like myself and he suggested the Rattlesnake and Rabbit with jalapeno peppers and caramelized onions. We ordered and walked down a narrow hallway, towards a lively area which was obviously the dining room. The place was fairly packed on a Monday night. Hipsters, artists, and young people all socializing loudly in a dimly lit room enjoying great food and beverages.As soon as I bit into the sausage and bun (basically a hot dog), I was immediately reminded of those delicious bacon-wrapped hot dogs that they sell on the streets of downtown. Succulent onions, crispy bun, and juicy sausage could never go wrong. I washed my meal down with an ice cold beer and a side of fries with Thai peanut dipping sauce. The fries were amazing and there's quite a variety of dipping sauces to choose from. Much to my surprise, after my meal, I realized that my sausage did indeed contain rattlesnake and rabbit!

So here's the format:- Line up in the front to order your sausages and beer in the front.- Go down the long hallway and find yourself in the back bar and seating area with your number- Hover and pounce on the first available spot on the communal or side tables, space can be scarce at peak times.- Wait for your food, and devour!- Repeat the drinks in the back barFood/drink roundup:- Duck, bacon, and jalapeno sausage &amp; buffalo, beef, pork, and chipotle: these were just plainly very tasty sausages. Could I tell there was duck, bacon or buffalo in these? No, but they tasted good and were juicy with a snap. These are a bit bigger than normal hotdog and 1 with fries filled me up, but some with bigger appetites (some guys) might want to get 2. These were off the exotic menu, so not sure how the other sausages are. Comes with 2 toppings of your choice of various peppers and onions.- Frites: Thicker type of belgian frite and definitely double fried. We got the blue cheese sauce and chipotle aoili. These were a bit rich, ketchup and mustard are provided on the tables. - Floris apple ale: Very fruity and nice for a non-beer drinker like me. Tasted pretty much like a good apple cider!Lowdown: Great place to chill and grab some sausages, frites, and beer in a hip downtown with a hipster vibe. Some of the exotics sound wild like rattlesnake, but when they're all ground in sausages, you can't tell, but darn tasty! If you're hitting it up at night, the back room is a cool lounge but crowded.

Yet another cool concept that was executed exceptionally well to enhance the downtown LA area. I was so impressed by my first experience at Wurstküche that I am constantly brainstorming good reasons to make the trek from Brentwood to downtown to go back. I came here for a birthday party for a close friend. There were about 12 of us. I can't comment on the parking being hard to find, as I took a taxi... but I can say that another member of our party got a prime parking spot right out in front, on a Saturday night. So it can't be THAT bad, right? The seating was a little bit of a challenge, seeing as we had a large group and it was Saturday night. The restaurant has communal-style seating, with lots of long tables, and no hostess to facilitate the process. Within 15 minutes, though, we had a table. A perfect amount of time to grab a beer at the bar and take a peek at the menu!The place has a very cool, funky vibe. The exterior of the building is very industrial and old looking, and the inside is very minimalist -- exposed brick walls, metal tables. Very casual and unassuming. I was totally digging the music, too. They had a pretty cool little spot set up in one corner for the DJ, and he was doing his job very well! I guess you could say it was a hipster hot spot, but there was definitely a good mix of patrons when we went. On to the food -- there were so many different selections to choose from! I like spicy food, so they recommended the buffalo, beef & pork sausage with chipotle peppers... I got additional green peppers on top, and chipotle aioli. SO GOOD. If I wouldn't have had to get in the back of the (quite long) line to get another one, I would have definitely ordered either the Austin Blues or the mango & jalapeno. The sausages aren't overwhelmingly large, so I would recommend getting a couple different ones to try! That being said, I didn't eat any fries... gave them up for Lent (doh!) but I heard they were phenomenal, and will be back to sample. So maybe one sausage is enough if you get fries too  Lastly, let's discuss the beer. SO MANY great beers to choose from! If you are overwhelmed by the selection, fear not. The bartenders are super nice, and if you tell them what you like in general, they'll give you a (free) flight of 5 or 6 beers to try, to make sure you enjoy what you order. I was impressed by this, in addition to the fact that they were willing to do this for me during peak business hours. I recommend the Spaten Optimator. Plus, it comes in a really kick ass stein!Overall a super fun and new experience! If you haven't gone yet, you must. I will be back!"},{"date":"2009-12-27","rating":"4.0","review":"Aside from its giggle-inducing name for the phonetically challenged, Wurstkuche is a cool little place. The dogs are pretty good -  not the best {that would be Top Dog in Berkeley} but good enough and the wacky varieties are one-of-a-kind.We had the Filipino Maharlika and the cilantro with green chiles. And the fries! I wish they had an even larger size for those babies - Uber Groot? We had the truffle oil glaze, curry ketchup, and aioli dippers. So good.My only gripe is the drink menu. I mean, really? $5 bottles of soda with flowers in it? Whatever happened to having a Coke and a smile?  I know, I know - I hear your big \"OMG\" and jaw dropping to the floor - they have a great selection of beer. But most times I'd really rather have a Coke. Mexican Coke, MmMmm...If you want to stick with the specialty-only theme, at least throw some Japanese Ramune soda into the mix.With all that said, the atmosphere is probably the best thing about this place - loud, fun, and casual enough for hanging out even if you've finished eating. I'll be back until I have tried ever single dog and dipper on the menu. They should start a wall of fame for that because I know I'm not the only fat ass who's thought about it."},{"date":"2011-08-12","rating":"4.0","review":"Best sausages I have ever had. Gourmet. Not only do you have a wide selection of traditional sausage flavors, you also have exotic options like rattlesnake, alligator, buffalo, rabbit, etc. (Rattlesnake + Rabbit has to be my favorite after trying all the exotic flavors - it's the juiciest and has a very special texture you won't find anywhere else) Even the bun is made to perfectly compliment the flavor and texture - toasted just right. The fries are the best fries I've ever had, props to the variety of dipping sauces (tried all, love the blue cheese with bacon and walnuts, and chipotle aioli sauses) The apple pie ice cream sandwich, though not made fresh, is still exquisite and completes the meal perfectly. Very reasonable pricing.The setting is casual and quite hip with a bar and very modern unique seating.  Great place for a business luncheon or hangout with friends. I live about 15 miles away, but it's definitely worth the drive. If I worked in LA, I'd probably be here every day."},{"date":"2012-11-13","rating":"5.0","review":"Good food and beer except if you go around 8 o'clock on a weekend night"},{"date":"2010-03-31","rating":"3.0","review":"Dining Date: 1/26/10Four of us head to Wurstkuche in the Arts District which serves a variety of grilled sausages.  Some are classics, some gourmet and some exotic.  I order a classic bockwurst (veal, pork) with sauerkraut and spicy peppers.  There are bottles of mustard on the wooden tables: whole grain, dijon, spicy brown, honey mustard and American yellow.  I settle on the what I think is the spicy brown, the bottles are not labeled.I like the cucumber infused water but others find it off putting. My coworkers are sharing an order of Belgian fries and I manage to taste a few. I love fries but try not to order them myself, I like to save room for other food. I'm always happy to steal a few if someone else does though.I glance around at my surroundings.  All the other times I've been to Wurstkuche have been late at night when it's it feels more like a loud clamoring bar.  I mean it does serve more varieties of beer than sausages.  You can order a beer here during lunch as well but the volume and space is casual and comfortable which allows you to have a conversation without making you hoarse.I've tried a few different sausages here and think I still prefer Evergood's all-beef Louisiana hot link sausages.  They're juicy and spicy, yum.  I also like Taiwanese sausage but that's a completely different category.  For me the draw at Wurstkuche is the atmosphere.  I like the vibe better than the actual food itself.For complete review and pics, go to"},{"date":"2013-01-15","rating":"4.0","review":"I am happy I went to this fun and festive place in downtown Los Angeles.

They have several varieties of sausages to choose from and unique bottled drinks like Ginger beer & my favorite Black Cherry soda. Everyone around me seemed to like their beer.Bring a friend because the arts district neighborhood coming from the, 101 freeway, is a little scary. But it is real close to downtown LA. They didn't have a visible sign on the outside on the building that I could see.  Wurstkuche is located on a corner which helps. Street parking by meter is what's available for $1 and hour. The place has a weird layout you have to order from around the corner down a hall and there isn't a sign inside telling you have to order that way. Again no signage. The food is delivered, by staff, in hot dog size metal trays made in a machine shop, some call that artsy. The bottom line is the food is good & unique. it's a nice open spot to people watch, somewhat cozy in size, but you get the feeling that the place is no frills. I find it a little pricey for what it is The area is the arts district and I like to support places that try to bring up the neighborhood.

Here's my first review in all this time, and no better place to start than with stuffed pork casings!This is a Must Try in L.A. I love sausage and this place does it right. Traditional sausage such as spicy italian can be on your plate along side an unexpectedly delicious alligator and pork sausage. Many beers on tap from fruity to hoppy; to expensive to low brow. Prices on all sausage, fries and most every beer is Very Reasonable. My meal is usually 2 sausage, 1 fries and a beer (plus whatever the bf gets) and it sets us back about $25, I want to say.The cons (There are always cons, Yelpers): 1-It's location is a block away from skid row, a very real place where drug deals and homeless people wandering and sleeping in boxes abounds. I do not recommend straying far from the restaurants in the area. 2- I hate hipsters, you might, too. 3- It's crowded and the line has been looong the dozens of times I have been here. To offset this issue, Ask For A Beer As Soon As Soon As You Pass Through The Front Door. You'll still be in line, but hey, it's tasty beer to ease your agitaiton."},{"date":"2010-06-10","rating":"5.0","review":"I came here for lunch with some of my co-workers and was surprised to find such an establishment just on the outskirts of Little Tokyo. For those of you who like OBEY or Shepard Fairey, there is a giant mural right across the street from this place. When I arrived after taking the DASH bus, the large wooden sliding doors remind you of a large barn or maybe the entrance to some night club. Lucky for our group there wasn't much of a line and we were able to place our orders pretty fast. I ordered something simple and decided to go with the regular bratwurst topped with grilled onions and grilled peppers. Every bite had an small explosion of oil and flavor. Although their sausages are a bit pricey, the quality is definitely well worth it. I've never tasted a brat or sausage that had so much flavor and that was so juicy. I definitely liked the different kinds of mustard and other toppings for your sausages. I remembered there was one that tasted a little Grey Poupon that I really liked. I don't really quite remember everything, so I'll have to make a trip out there probably this weekend. Unfortunately I didn't get to try any of their beers since I had to go back to work. I definitely give them two thumbs up for their wide selection of German and Belgian beers. It's nice to see an establishment with more than just Stella Artois on their beer menu. I also like the very modern yet chic decor of the place. Bare concrete floors with uncovered brick and stainless accents such as the beer taps. I like how the interior design is very European and almost has an Swedish Ikea feel to it. The solid wood benches reminds me a little of a German beer hall and wide open rear that has A LOT more seating. Definitely extra points in my book for the chill ambient house music that was playing that day. =)Final Thoughts:I'm definitely glad I was introduced to this place by my coworkers and for anyone who is thinking of trying this place, you should just go try it out. Be sure to get the full experience though (sausage, fries, and a cup or goblet of beer). The fare here is a little bit more pricey, but well worth the money spent. =)Too many tofu eating, free hugging, Green Peace Vegans and Vegetarians complain a little too much.

Now, onto my review.Finding this place was not easy, but that's because the back of it faces a major street (Alameda I believe) while the front of it faces a tiny side street that we neglected to park on. It feels as if you're walking into a Speakeasy during the prohibition era.Let me say that Wurstküche was so highly recommended that my friend was told, \"before you leave LA for Oregon and if you can only go out for one meal, this is the one to try\". My friend's friend (still with me?) couldn't have been more true.As I went down the vast menu, I saw a few things stand out considering there are about 20 different options, namely the Austin Blues, of which I added saurkraut and spicy peppers (a must if you like things hot). I tried a bite of my friend's rattlesnake and wasn't terribly impressed.But when you come to a place as unique and out of the way such as this, you can't just order one thing, so I went ahead and also got the Mango Jalapeño with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. I have to say, the Mango was one of the best combinations humanly possible and I would highly recommend it.But one of the best parts of the meal had to be the fried. They use sea salt (I think), but they were just the right texture and had just the right crisp to each individual bite. Needless to say I devoured them and tried not to share.To wash it down? I definitely recommend the cucumber soda. Think of it as a Mojito minus the alcohol and mint; it's extremely refreshing and a nice pick me up after clogging your arteries full of deliciousness. Great, now I'm hungry just thinking about this place."},{"date":"2010-05-20","rating":"5.0","review":"After hearing my boyfriend rave about his rabbit veal white wine sausages, and how amazing the ice cream cookie sandwiches are, I was more than curious. He mentioned the alligator or rattlesnake or whatever else--but also let me know there were plenty of veg options. I'm no longer vegetarian, per se, but I still tend to eat like it.So we went on a Saturday afternoon and the line was huge. But, since we had already planned on it and had the time, we waited. It was strange at first because we were in this line and there is only 1 cash register and it takes so long to order and the front room is tiny and packed... but then, after ordering, you go into the back and the place is spread out and calm and really nice. Industrial looking. Oh, and weirdest thing! A guy I knew in high school was manning the reg. Nice surprises. He always gets the rabbit, and I got the Italian Veggie which was so freaking good. Got both carmelized onions and sweet peppers on mine but the sweet peppers weren't good on the sausage. They were good by them selves and I ate them alone, but the sausage was much better with just the onions. And then, of course, we had an ice cream sandwich to top it off. And cucumber water? Now, that's something fancy right there. I'd give three thumbs if I had them."},{"date":"2010-02-22","rating":"5.0","review":"I've been dying to find a place like this in LA, and here it is. A modern beer hall, with great eats and even better beer. If you're the sausage loving type (clean minds people) and would like to follow it with a delicious beer of any variety, than this is your place.I have tried both the bratwurst and a vegan, both tasty and satisfying, and the beer... NO Bud or Miller, but quality Belgians and Hefs, so many that I can't recount.The seating is something of a retro beer hall, with community tables and lots of room.It should be considered a classic LA spot, if it isn't already."},{"date":"2011-03-27","rating":"3.0","review":"Exotic sausages appeal to me, but at the end of the day; sausages are sausages."},{"date":"2010-07-24","rating":"3.0","review":"Interesting concept and good beer.   The fries are good (especially with the truffle oil) and the vibe is \"hip.\"   it's a bit pricey for what you get - guess you're paying for the exotic sausages and hip location.  I left feeling a bit hungry because the portions are not all that big."},{"date":"2010-08-26","rating":"4.0","review":"Come here for the experience and the exotic grilled sausages.

It's part of the experience.- Choice of Toppings: Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers, Spicy Peppers. Choose two.- Dipping Sauce for Fries:  Get the White Truffle Oil Glaze, Chipotle Aioli, or Curry Ketchup.- Beer Selection: 24 draft, 18 bottle. Draft beer includes Chimay White.- Nice gastro pub vibe with live music. Young crowd.Cons:- The bun tends to be a bit soggy and not crispy enough.- Long lines. This place is very popular with young college-students. - Only parking available is street parking, and it's really hard to find. - The location is not in the best part of Downtown. It's not safe for girls to walk alone to and from their cars. - Service attitude. Cashier is almost always impatient and rude and in a bad mood. The servers often mess up your order. - Our server spilled beer and fries on us, they replaced the beer and fries, but we didn't get anything taken off our bill or even an apology.- Music is a bit loud to hold a conversation. Not good for a first date.- Pricey. Be prepared to spend about $25 for two sausages, a beer, and some fries.Tip: The entrance can be a bit confusing. If you enter into a room with a large dining area and a bar, go back outside and enter from the other door. Tip: If you are a KCRW member, there is a 15% discount.Tip: Stay away from the Spicy Pepper if you really want to taste the meat.Tip: Not a good place for a large group during peak hours. This is a popular spot.Bottom Line: The experience of eating exotic animals and the beer selection is what makes this place worthwhile. This place is not quite as good as Top Dog in Berkeley, but it's one of the best LA has to offer, and it's one that will allow you to pretend like you are Andrew Zimmern from Bizarre Foods."},{"date":"2013-01-31","rating":"4.0","review":"This place is pretty different from anywhere else I've eaten- it looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, but has a classy gastropub-industrial feel in it on the inside.  Their menu is pretty much exclusively sausage and brats- of which they have strange and exotic varieties.  This is where the appeal of this place is.  The sausages are all amazing, and are made differently than you can find anywhere else.  The menu is a little pricey for me, but it's very palatable if you don't go to often.  It's also close to my college campus, USC, which is a definite plus."},{"date":"2011-06-01","rating":"3.0","review":"I have been to Wurstkuche twice because my friends love the place. I don't eat red meat, and since the sausages have pork casings, I had to pick one of the vegetarian sausages. I tried the Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sage. I mean, it has potatoes AND apples in it! How could that not be good?! Suffice it to say I was sorely disappointed in the sausage. It tasted awful.Luckily, Wurstkuche had a saving grace. The belgian fries with white truffle oil glaze, Mr. Q Cumber soda, and Toasted Apple Pie Ice Cream Sandwich were enough to keep me happy. Having never ordered the fries without the truffle oil, I don't know how the regular one tastes. But I'll happily pay the $1.50 extra in the hopes that it makes a big difference. The cucumber soda is completely refreshing, and the ice cream sandwich is just incredible. You can only order the ice cream sandwich at the bar in the main eating area. It is apple pie ice cream sandwiched between oatmeal raisin cookies--simply divine.The second time I went back to Wurstkuche, I decided against trying one of the other vegetarian sausages (none of them sounded appetizing, and my bill without a sausage was already coming up on $20). I doubt I'll ever order another veggie sausage unless they come up with a new one with more appetizing spices. For what it is, the restaurant is extremely over-priced. I would not recommend it to non-meat eaters unless you are okay with just fries, a drink, and dessert."},{"date":"2010-04-22","rating":"4.0","review":"Dare I say overpriced?I just did.So here it is from a vegetarian's POV:I can take a Field Roast sausage, put it in a grilled bun, top it with onions and call it a day for a buck fifty. Here it's $6. Nothing special. No twists, no special toppings(unless you think sauerkraut is special). I'm sure it's a much different experience for someone chowing down on a rattlesnake dog, but that's just not my bag.Glass of belgium beer was overpriced...not offensively so, but still 'spensive. And with all the different pours they do for each beer, it might be a decent idea to identify if a beer is a 20oz or a 10oz...On the positive side of things:Belgium fries=awesomepicnic tables with craft paper=awesomemusic=awesomeSo here's my two cents...have a couple pints at spitz/weilands during happy hour and head over here to soak up that fine fermented barley and hops with a sausage."},{"date":"2010-01-02","rating":"3.0","review":"I was really hoping to like Wurstkuche a lot more than I did. I came in hearing a lot of hype, and looking at the menu, I got super excited. Unfortunately, most everything was just kind of meh, and not nearly exciting enough to get me going out of my way to go back.I shared the chicken apple & spices and the duck, bacon, and jalapeno sausages. I guess the problem with sausages is, unless you ram the flavors down my throat, they're all gonna blend together and disappear. The chicken apple was light and a little cinnamony, but mostly...just tasted like sausage. The duck and bacon was moist...but still just was like a sausage. I loved the buns, sweet, soft, but still holding up, and the toppings, but if I had closed my eyes, I couldn't have told you what I was eating.The fries, on the other hand, were amazing. Crispy, potato-y, and with all sorts of crazy dipping sauces. We got the tzatziki, Thai peanut, chipotle aioli, and buttermilk ranch and all were fantastic. Doubt you can go wrong with their fries. The beer selection is great (albeit a little intimidating), but in the end, if you're a sausage restaurant, you gotta have amazing sausages, not just crazy ones. Wurstkuche just isn't to that point yet."},{"date":"2010-09-27","rating":"5.0","review":"I usually come during the lunch hour to beat the long lines.First time going at night Friday and went Sunday the week before. Tried the Duck brat from the exotics and Vegetarian with smoked apple sage. I love the game taste of the Duck and the spicyness. Usually always get the Rattlesnack and Rabbit, but needed to try something new. Tried the Buffalo before, seemed kind of tough. Haven't tried the Rabbir Veal yet. Love how the place seems so hole-in-the wall and when you enter its different. Love the main room, different mustards, the atmosphere, music, and beer selections.My bf isn't really a hipster like me, his sister had her birthday at Wurstkuche and he actually liked it. He loves everything about it too.

The method of ordering. Waiting in a line 30+ mins that is stretching down half a block is not fun. They need some other method of ordering such that I can place my order then go enjoy my beer without standing on the sidewalk for half an hour.

Wurstkuche's got your exotic, good-tasting dog waiting for you in this hip little warehouse of a place in L.A.  Located in the Arts District, you will find a number of young people, professionals and foodies alike that will grub here. It's odd how the restaurant looks average on the outside (due to the neighborhood of warehouses in the area) but a hip hang out once you walk in. You stand in line to order your favorite dog. Their menu consists of plenty of 'dog heaven' selections, such as chicken, pork, beef or a mix of the three OR if you want to go adventurous, try their exotic sausages! I was down for something different so attempted to order the alligator/andouille sausage. It was a bit dry and honestly could not taste much of the gator meat (I was really looking forward for gator!). I also got to try their Belgian Fries with curry ketchup (interesting, interesting) and their blue cheese/bacon dipping sauces. Their chipotle sauce was good, too. Now lets talk about the seating. Crowded on benches. Ha! Really! They also have a DJ that played some dance/rock music in the background. Very trendy. So the \"W\" gets only 4 stars because the service was a bit slow and the seats weren't all that comfortable.

From the girl who says \"i dont drink beer, i think its disgusting\"  (PS.. you can shut her up by ordering her 'the floris apple ale', its like an unfiltered pear cider from yardhouse, but waaay better) or to the man who likes his beer dark and full bodied ( Erdinger Dunkelwiezen)  I have yet to try them all.  BTW, i recomend the La Chouffe.  Golden Ale 8%... it has a nice finish to it. As for me, i tried Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned with White Wine and Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers, i was expecting a more gamey taste, but it tasted like what i expected.. like a salty and meaty sausage. My friend had the SantaFe Jack Cheese & Jalapeño Peppers,  which was not as spicy as i thought it would be, but def had a nice kick to it.

I'm not knocking this place because I dig it.  (Wurst in German means something along the lines of 'sausage'. Don't ask me what 'kuche' with two dots above the 'u' means.)  I dig that it's casual, low-key, stylish-in-an-ironic way and prices are reasonable. You order at a counter, then take your gourmet hot dog and glass of imported beer to a dimly lit cozy general lounge area filled with highly simplistic/minimalistic seats and tables probably from Ikea. Most of their beer is imported from Germany or Belgium and will run the standard $6-7 unless it's their cider-type beer -- that's $8 or $9. Can't say anything about the hot dogs, I just had beer that night -- do you think the record company would mind?"}]
