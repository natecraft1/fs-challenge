During my most recent visit, my boyfriend & I devoured 4 sausages & a large order of fries:* Bratwurst w/ Onion & Kraut * Louisiana w/ Onion & Kraut * Hot Italian w/ Onion & Hot Peppers * Duck & Bacon w/Kraut The fries are STILL the best - so much crispy potato. I loved all the sausages but if I had to pick one that I'd order again, it'd be the Bratwurst. Simple & super flavorful. Everything is a little on the saltier side but nothing a little La Chouffe (golden ale 8% ABV 250 ml) can't solve. I haven't found La Chouffe elsewhere yet but I'm not a big beer drinker!5 years later, still can't pronounce Wurstkuche."

If you're lucky, they'll serve a sample to their patiently waiting guests. This certainly helps to expedite things in a customer-friendly way. They've got a wide selection of beers to satisfy any beer aficionado (or not).My sample: The mango jalapeño was a subtly sweet wiener with a kick. I don't normally like mangos but this one's a winner.I ended up getting the chicken apple spice with caramelized onions (peppers give me acid reflux) and a large side of fries. My dog was a bit sweeter than I thought, especially with the onions, but overall was good. My boo got the bratwurst which was deeelicious. Their fries are large, well-seasoned and come with a choice of 2 sauces. The tzatziki sauce is quite light and adds a subtle cream flavor to the fries. My pick would be the chipotle aioli- yummy! They additionally have traditional ketchup, mustard condiments on the tables. Definitely would visit again"

If you don't know what to look for you'll totally miss it. Plenty of street parking available. Front of the restaurant looks like a warehouse. LoL. They have a wide selection of both alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. I had no idea there were so many different kinds of sausages. My friend and I ordered the two most famous sausages on the menu. Pretty darn pricey too for sausage. After ordering we head over to the back of the restaurant and see cafeteria style seating.  Food came out pretty quickly. I was not impressed. I almost want to say that I would have enjoyed a plain hot dog way better. The meat was a bit too spicy for my liking. I wish they had mentioned that in the menu. But like I said, I'm not a big sausage fan."

So crunchy on the outside, nice & fluffy on the inside. Totally worth it to get groot fries. Plus, you'll eat more than your fair share. Vegetarian Apple smoked sage: great flavor & the bun was wonderful and soft. Topping- pick 2: sauerkraut, grilled onions, or peppers (either sweet or spicy). Order of operation: walk in & you're in the back of the restaurant. - grab a menu, choose wisely (3 veggie options)- order w/2 toppings (get fries!)- take your number to the back & find a place to sit, possibly at a long communal table. Talking is hard because a dj is spinning. There's also a bar. Interesting ambiance..."

Here's what my boyfriend and I ordered:- Large order of belgian fries ($5.50) which comes with 2 dipping sauces of your choice. We got the chipotle aioli and pesto mayo. My fave was the chipotle aioli! These fries are no joke. They're crispy and thick cut fries! My BF and I immediately became big fans of their fries. - An Exotic sausage \"Lamb with mediterranean spices (x2)\" ($8) w/ caramelized onions and sweet peppers for myself. This choice came with not one but TWO sausages in between the bun. Only because the sausage was so thin compared to the other options. Anyways, I loved every bite of it! It was moist and super flavorful. It was cooked perfectly. - A Classic sausage \"Bockwurst\" ($6) w/ caramelized onions and sweet pepper for my BF. My BF enjoyed it a lot. But I wasn't a huge fan of it. -I washed down my food with a belgian beer, the La Chouffe ($8). It is a golden ale, which paired very well with the food. The only CON which I can really pinpoint is the choice of bread/bun they use. It could have been better. 5 stars for the service and ambiance!"

Ate it with caramelized onions and ketchup.  Chicken Apple & Spices - Flavorful and delicious. Really really good. You can definitely taste the sweetness from the apple. it was great. Ate it with onions and ketchup. Louisiana Hot Link - The bf had this one (I didn't try a piece). He said it was good, but not as good as the Chicken Apple. They had a live DJ and there is a full bar in the back. Great place to go with friends. Food and drinks came out to about $45 for the two of us."

Right in the middle of the Art District (check out the rest of the area and the wall art while you're there)! Parking was easy to find but I was lucky since we were able to find a meter close by. This is a special spot primarily focused on a variety specialty sausages and beer. Very easy to order and a large variety to order from - you can try some very exotic meat there. After you order, find a seat in the back. I love the casual vibe they provide. It is definitely one of the top spots I bring friends who go to LA for the first time - cool new food, good beer and drinks if you want it, and a great venue in a nice area! Must go!"

However, I think this place is worth that struggle.The way this place works is you order at the cashier and they give you a number. Then you seat yourself and they bring you your food. I've been here twice and both times the line was out the door. However, it moves fairly fast. They have someone monitoring the line to see if you have any questions. They'll also get your drink order so you can sip on something while you wait, which is nice.This place is known for super exotic sausages like rattlesnake and rabbit. I'm not that much of an adventurer, so I opted for less exotic choices. I've tried the Chicken Apple & Spices, which comes with 2 sausages. I've also tried the Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers, which has a kick to it. Both of these were pretty good! Also all hot dogs come with a choice of 2 toppings. I always opt for the caramelized onions and sweet peppers.They also have some pretty good fries. I usually get a few orders with my friends and pick different sauces so we can have a variety. My favorite is the chipotle aioli!They have a pretty good drink menu with a variety of beers. My go-to is the Fruli which is a strawberry beer. It's super yummy and doesn't taste like beer at all, which is perfect for the girly-girl in me.The seating area has a bunch of long picnic tables. And the times I've been here, they have a DJ spinning some sick tunes. Definitely a cool place to come with friends or on a casual date. And afterwards, you can continue the fun by hitting up the various bars & breweries in the arts district!"

Their menu has some adventurous flavored that will satisfy any pallet.Suggested for meat lovers:Louisiana hot link (although is is suppose to be\"spicy,\" to me, it was not really spicy)Mango jalapeño - great option to try something new. Definitely recommend.Fries:Heads up the fries are large and thick. I got the truffle oil added ($2) but I think you are better off with the original. If you like crispy and thinner fries, you won't be a fan of these fries.EnvironmentThe eating area is awesome. Unexpected vibe in the back. The link for the hotdogs is a bit of a turn off, but good news is that you can order any drinks prior to ordering your food."

        "review": "The fries, oh those fries!The double fried, crunchy Belgian style fries are some of the best I've ever had, and they're served in a paper cone in true Belgian fashion. Get it with chipotle aioli or any of Wurstkuche's many sauces and you'll be in crunch heaven.But the sausages, what Wurstkuche is most famous for, fell short of my expectations. I appreciate their incredibly clever and outright wicked combinations (rattlesnake + rabbit?! pheasant?!) but I found them to be a little small and inside a bun that just muted the flavors of the meat. Almost never do I say that a restaurant in San Diego is better than one in big city L.A., but Wurstkuche is not as good as Scott Slater's S&M Sausage and Meat eatery 120 miles south where the sausages are bigger, the bread is better and the meat is juicier.Still, I love the concept of Wurstkuche with its meat counter, craft beers on tap, sausages priced $6-$8, and beautifully hipster dimly lit dining room, so I will be back....especially for those fries."

I could tell by the crowd that the food must be good lol. Two of us arrived first and were greeted by a young lady taking drink orders. She was very sweet and informative on the beers. I highly enjoyed the light beer that I picked. When it came down to placing my order, the guy at the register was approachable and made me feel comfortable at the fact I had no clue what to order. I finally ordered the vegetarian Apple sage with onions and sweet peppers. Luckily the three of us were able to find seats after ordering. Everything was great from the beer to the food, and ambiance. Here is where I had an issue. Two of us went to the bar to get another drink. There was a male and a female with dark long curly hair. I meant to get her name(thought about taking her picture, but I'm not that petty) My friend and I had been standing at the bar for about 5 minutes with no eye contact or greeting made. The male bartender made his way to the other end leaving the girl with curly hair at the other end where we were standing. Two males had approached the bar after us, and she immediately greeted them and took their order. I was blown away. My first thought was to go get a drink at the front, however there was a long line. My friend and I went to other end and the male bartender assisted us. Just with that experience alone almost makes me not want to come back, however I highly enjoyed myself will be back."

I came with a friend on a Sunday evening, only to be greeted by a monstrous line that went out the door, but it ended up moving pretty quickly so we only waited maybe 20 minutes or so. We decided to split the Sun Dried Tomato & Mozzarella and the Chicken Apple, just for some variety, as well as a large order of fries. Man, oh man, I was NOT disappointed! Of the two sausages, I think I liked the Sun Dried Tomato one better, just because it had more of a flavorful kick to it, whereas the Chicken Apple was a little more tame, but still very good. The fries though...THE FRIES. The girl who was directing the line recommended that we get the Chipotle Aioli and the BBQ and to double dip the sauces, and she definitely hit the nail on the head with that one. Even without the sauces, the fries were still deep, deep fried to perfection.The seating area has a really cool ambience to it. You can choose from smaller tables for more privacy, or longer picnic-style tables covered in paper and crayons if you're with a bigger group or just feel like reverting back to your childhood self! There's also a bar where you can order drinks and sit at for a more intimate setting. The place is dim and definitely very casual, making for a fun but low-key place to chill with some friends.I didn't try any of their beers this time...I know, I know, how could I?! But their extensive list of draft and bottled beers means there's something for everyone. I will DEFINITELY be back to try some of those, maybe accompanied by some more exotic links that I wasn't gutsy enough or emotionally prepared to try this time (rattlesnake and rabbit, anyone??)"

I just started working downtown and while I cannot afford to eat out all the time, I do like an excuse to get out of the office and check out all that downtown has to offer. The food is great.  So far I have tried the jalapeno mango sausage and the hot Italian. They are delicious.With that said, I am not sure anything can beat the Belgian fries. I never had these before, so I was not sure what to expect, I do know that seeing them pass me by as servers were taking them to the customers, they looked delicious. I got the Klein-sized fries (which is pretty big) and a side of the chipotle aioli sauce. Holy $#!@ were these amazing. Completely elevated this place to an insane level of deliciousness. The seating is community style with long tables covered in brown paper, I find myself talking to others not only about this place but other eateries we all like to frequent. In fact I learned of other places that I had not heard of before. The portions are plenty. between the sausage and the fries along with a drink (several draft beers as well as old timey sodas in glass bottles) is sure to leave you more than full, but also planning your next trip back.

It looks closed off, but you go around the hallway to where seating is.  There's ample amount of seating space and ALL YOUR MUSTARD selections are on almost every table.  I really like how they have so many options for mustard. I think there were six different bottles. Anyway, it does take a while for food to arrive.  I ordered the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage (under the exotic meat section) with caramelized onions and spicy peppers.  The price for just this including tax is $8.72.  I think it's a bit overpriced for something so small, and it wasn't that filling either.  They have other things under the exotic meat section like duck and lamb (I personally don't consider those exotic though).  It was delicious, but I couldn't really tell if the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage really tasted any different than any other meat.  So, I wasn't too wow-ed.  Still pretty cool to say that I have eaten/tried rattlesnake/rabbit.  If you really wanted to eat rattlesnake or rabbit for what they really are and see how they really really really taste like, go to an Asian restaurant or something. Now I'm wondering if those restaurants exist in America. Overall, neat place and nice staff.  They have a nice selection of drinks and beers.  This place seems pretty cool to sit back and chill with a beer."

Also really nice that once you got into the lobby area the took your beer order to keep you happy during those final moments in line.I went for the chicken apple with spices topped with grilled onions and spice peppers. No meal is complete without a side order so I definitely added those belgian fries with pesto mayo and chipotle ketchup. Personally I didn't appreciate the limit of sauces and the fact that it was 75 cents for each extra tub.The seating area is really nice and the bring the food to you fairly quickly. Its still pretty self serve as the napkins and any utensils you may need are off to the side. They due have a bar out back as well if you are appetizing another beer. I went for the Houblon Chouffe which was quite floral but still very tasty.The ambience was very \"hipster\" and they were playing house music pretty loudly in the main eating area making it a little hard to have a regular conversation. Overall a good meal and I wouldn't mind coming back."

I headed over with some folks for dinner one night to see how good their sausages really were.They have a pretty large variety of sausages and have them on display up front. Even though I knew I wanted exotic meats, I still had a hard time deciding. I finally went with Duck and Bacon with Jalapenos, Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapenos, and Pheasant. All came served on a bun with peppers and onions. All 3 sausages were delicious, served fresh and piping hot, and each one had a unique flavor profile that tickled my taste buds. The Duck & Bacon was my favorite, but I could easily order any of them again, even though I would love to try some of the other flavors, too. We also ordered Belgian fries Groot (2 dipping sauces), and they were some of the best fries I have had in a while. The Blue Cheese Walnut and Bacon dipping sauce in particular is very tasty and is a sauce I definitely want to order again.The restaurant itself is very casual in the sense that you line up to order, take a number and find a table. The restaurant was quite crowded on a Wednesday evening, and the later it got the busier it became. They also have a very good draught beer list, primarily focusing on Belgian and German varieties. The prices seemed pretty reasonable, and the food was very good. If you like sausage, then you should check out Wurstkuche. You won't be disappointed."

So good & totally worth the price. Everyone there was friendly and they really organize the line when you walk it so that it's not all chaotic with people standing everywhere (cause their ordering room is not very big). I definitely like their eating room; its very inviting and offers ample enough of seating, including the outdoor patio along the sidewalk. They also have complementary water. Will be back... & hopefully try their other location in the Venice area!"

Laurie P and I walked in through the front passing a refrigerator filled with at least 12 different types of uncooked sausages. Since we weren't there to eat, we went straight to the back, to the bar. Our bartender was a lovely young woman, very helpful and friendly in helping me find a beer. She offered me samples before I made my choice. I don't read zee German words and butchered the name of my beer. Lucky for me, I just pointed and said \"that one!\"The area it is in looked rather industrial. We found parking on the street, but I saw there's a private lot near by.The staff was friendly. The establishment is clean. My beer was good! I hope I'll get to return and really experience the food and more of the other things this place has to offer! But I like it!"

Side note they have Many dipping sauces for the fries. Even better is the beer. My favorite is Aventinus. Usually 1 does the job!Parking is tight and this place gets really busy on the weekend.I recommend going on a Wednesday or Thursday night.Crowds are eclectic, they are located in the middle of the art district."

Best time to come on a weekend to avoid any wait or line is around 11:30am, just before noon because shortly after, the line does get long. Don't fret if you do see a line going outside as you drive by because the counter where you order is small and close to the door so there will always be people waiting outside.In a nutshell, all brats comes with 2 toppings of your choice: caramelized onions, sweet or spicy peppers, or sauerkraut. Basic bratty's for $6, premium for $7, and exotic for $8.I got the premium brat with caramelized onions and sauerkraut.  He got the rabbit and pork with sweet pepper and sauerkraut for $8.  We also got a side of their large fries for $6.  You can also order their raw links to go for 30% off.After you order and get your number, you walk to the back, past the restrooms, and you'll find a huge seating area, including a bar and patio outside for those who wish bring their dogs.  Every table has a set of condiments-- ketchup and different kinds of mustards. Tasty food. Great venue. Free water.  Good service... but don't expect them to be back because it's really a self-serving place.  I really enjoyed this place and wouldn't mind coming back!"

Once inside they start taking your drink order, so you can drink before you order. This place has a variety of sausages, even a few vegetarian options. You can order your sausage with or without a baked roll and add peppers and sweet onions. We each ordered vegetarian sausages, smoked apple sage and Mexican chipotle. We also ordered belgian fries. The smoked apple sage topped with peppers and sweet onions was savory. I would definitely try a meat option next time. Fries were good. This place was huge, a communial table setting, unless you find a table just for your group. It gets pretty loud, we had to shout at each other. There is another bar in the back in case you finish your beer before you walk to the back. Overall, I would come again."

It was my first time in the Arts District, so I was very confused about finding my way around, into the building, & even where to order my food. Once I found my way, it was like I was lost my whole life without it. So the seating area & bar entrance is the door on the corner of 3rd & Traction. You order food at the counter which you can enter from Traction Ave or working you're way through the hall behind the seating area.Their selection of sausage meat ranges from traditional to exotic so you can decide how adventurous you want your weiner. I decided to go in deep and try their Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño peppers topped with caramelized onions & sweet peppers, and I was astonished. It was so full of flavor without tasting too gamey. Their selection of mustards were all great with my favorite being the spicy brown. I definitely will be coming back to explore & taste their other meats... Don't read too much into to that..."

Their workers are really knowledgeable about the pairings of beer and hot dogs. They offer a wide range of hot dogs, ranging from veggie dogs to snake dogs. You can definitely step outside your comfort zone when coming here. They offer different kinds of mustards and ketchup on the table that pair well with the dogs.

My group ordered a couple different options from the original, gourmet, and exotic options. I did not fall head over heals by any of them, but the saving grace is the beer and the ambiance. Cool place to start or end off your night, as the kitchen is open until 1:30 am. Enjoy!"

I feel like for some people lamb is an acquired taste but I have acquired it !!!! Lamb definitely tastes different from any other meat (like beef or pork etc) but it has found an amazing home at wurstkuche... Yes to lamb ! Also I love that they have a wide variety of hot dog options including some lesser known/eaten meats. (They even have vegetarian options) There were two hot dogs in one bun (both very thin) but I didn't hate it. I will say that the bun was very tough to chew at times but overall a great eat. My favorite thing about this place is the number of different sauces they have and how they're laid out on all the tables so you have the easiest access. I won't say I didn't make a mess but it was definitely a beautiful and tasty mess."

If you can't seem to find the place it's a corner spot with huge doors near umami and pie hole.I tried the Buffalo, Mango Jalapeno, Duck and Rabbit. Yup, all some exotic types of hot dogs. They have some that are a bit more tame but if you're waiting forever to get into this joint, go big or go home. I enjoyed all the ones I've tried except for the rabbit, though it might just be a taste preference. I found it too gamey for me and only took one or two bites of it. All the rest were on point. You have a choice of putting sweet pepper, which I definitely recommend. The fries are thick cut and comes with sauces for dipping. My favorite of the ones I've tried is the chipotle aioli and pesto mayo. I have yet to get the beer here but I will in the near future.  If you just want to try this place out, the line during lunch is way shorter than the dinner line. But there's definitely a better overall atmosphere if you come during dinner time."

I can't wait to bring uninitiated friends here.One note: Careful if you order the Lamb with Mediterranean spices.

Brat breakdown:Original Brat: it was slightly dry, but the best of the 3 we tried.  Nothing special as far as the seasoning, as far as I could tell, but not a bad brat. And the buns were pretty decent.Duck with Bacon:  maybe we got a wiener that was unlucky in the bacon department, but there was hardly a hint of bacon (not sure I even tasted it).  Otherwise, it was lackluster, but not bad tasting.Snake: again, nothing special, except it's interesting to say you've had snake - now mark that off your bucket list.  The flavor was not bad - in fact, it did have an interesting spice to it, but you could have told me it was pork, or cat, or zebra, and I wouldn't have known it was an alternative meat.  But if I were caught stranded in the desert, I would now have no problem eating rattler, if I had to...All in all, a fun place to try, but not a place I would haunt."

There is a long, extensive beer list that offers something for every palette. The dining area is reminiscent of an Oktoberfest Beer Hall. It's sort of a communal dining experience in that you'll seat yourself at a large picnic style table with other diners. It's a really fun place to come with a big group or for a celebration, just try to get there early to reserve a table because it gets packed. At night, there's usually a DJ present to liven things up. It's honestly a fun spot to just spend an evening out with friends. Highly recommended for good casual dining!"

If you come on a weekend be prepared to wait in a long line that could take about 40 minutes. It's the type of place that you order, receive a number, and they'll bring the food to your table. There's communal dining as well as separate tables, but everything's first come first serve so it depends what you can snag. Weekends are exciting since there's usually dj's spinning sick beats.As a vegetarian, this place makes me giddy inside with excitement. All the vegan options are so good!!!  Don't worry meat lovers, obviously there are plenty of meat options too. For the risk takers there's rattlesnake, rabbit, duck, and pheasant. I recommend ordering at least two sausages. Fries are think, crispy and full of deliciousness. Don't get me started on the great selection of dipping sauces. There's 10 to choose from, and even truffle glaze.During this visit it's also crucial that you visit The Pie Hole located right across the street for dessert. The combination of foods is kinda mandatory."

I ordered the Rattlesnake & Rabbit exotic sausage and it came with Jalapeno Peppers, Sweet Peppers and Caramelized Onions and it was phenomenal in every aspect. The second sausage I ordered was the Duck & Bacon and that came with Jalapeno Peppers, Sauerkraut and Spicy Peppers and that was also very delicious. The 3 dipping sauces I ordered for the fries were Bleu Cheese Walnut & Bacon, Chipotle Aioli and Thai Peanut and all 3 were very tasty. I would highly recommend you try this place out if you have not yet had the opportunity to. I can't wait to go back and try the other sausage varieties that they have available."

On this occasion I was not at the Kingdom of God but at the Kingdom of Sausages, Wurstkuche! By the end of my visit, all I could think and say was \" Oh my God \" It was so good!Wurstkuche is known for their glorious sausage and anyone that knows me knows I love me some sausage. I don't discriminate and love all kinds of sausage. I love big sausage, thick sausage, juicy sausage, meaty sausage and plump sausage. As long as it looks good and sounds delicious, I'll put it in my mouth.Upon entering, I was already salivating and couldn't wait to satisfy my sausage craving. Though the line was to the door, I eagerly waited while deciding which type of sausage to devour.The Menu:EXOTICS $8.00Buffalo, beef and porkDuck and baconRattlesnake and rabbitRabbit and porkLamb with Mediterranean spicesPheasant with herbsGOURMET $7.00Mango and jalapenoChicken and appleAustin bluesSun dried tomatoesFilipino maharlikaLouisiana hot linkKielbasa CLASSICS $6.00BratwurstBrock wurstHot ItalianVegetarian ItalianVegetarian smoked apple sageVegetarian Mexican chipotleThe Grub:I ordered the Filipino Maharlika with caramelized onions and sauerkraut and he ordered the rabbit and pork with caramelized onions and spicy peppers plus a small order of Belgium fries.The Filipino Maharlika was insanely good! With just the right amount of sweetness and a slight touch of spicy, it was the perfect balance and combination. Just like the Maharlika, the Rabbit and pork sausage was equally good with plenty of flavor in each bite. I had no regrets eating Thumper! Sorry Bambi but Thumper sure was delicious.Tip:Skip the classics and go for the gourmet or exotics.Overall:Wurstkuche has been Yelped 6684 times. What are you waiting for!? Cool little Hipster place with a DJ spinning the table while you relax and enjoy some good eats. Believe the hype! It's real."

        "review": "You're probably thinking, what could possibly be so exciting about sausages? Other than pairing it with countless of Belgian and German craft beers, I'm ecstatic about their link offerings ranging from classics, gourmet, and my favorite -- exotics. LOUISIANA HOT LINK ($7) falls under gourmet and is stuffed with beef and pork as well as other spices. Those that love a good kick would appreciate the knockout flavor this has to offer. Add sweet peppers and caramelized onions then you'll have yourself a juxtaposition of sweet and spicy. I would get this if you're feeling unadventurous but appreciate a little heat. Their DUCK & BACON w/ jalapeno peppers ($8) was surprisingly my least favorite of the night as I love duck and come on, who doesn't love bacon? I couldn't detect each unique flavor and the duo just didn't work for me, let alone the overcooked texture of the sausage and dry bun. Care to partake in something a little more exciting? The RATTLESNAKE & RABBIT w/ jalapeno peppers ($8) is a whole other story. It perfectly fits the bill for \"exotic\" while its mild and buttery profiles were to say the least enticing. The onions and spicy peppers which I chose as my toppings married so well with it, plus, I added mustard for that extra \"umph\". Easily my #1 choice that evening.To take it to the next level, their double dipped BELGIAN FRIES ($5.50/L) is not to be missed. A large already comes with two dipping sauces so I went with THAI PEANUT and CURRY KETCHUP for something out of the norm. Yes, their fries are exceptional but their sauces are just as impressive. Varying types of mustard are available (for free) on the tables, therefore, share. So happy they have honey, grain, and regular mustard. Don't let the outside line deter you from coming. Once indoors, you'll have the option to start imbibing from their impressive beer list to make the wait bearable (while still in line). Pay as you order and head straight to the back where communal tables and a bar await you. We went on a Saturday night with a live DJ in the house. You can just imagine the upbeat vibe of the place...it was exhilarating."

Anyways as I stood in line looking at their sausages thinking to myself if I should go with the safe side and get the duck/bacon or should I go with the rattle snake/rabbit...screw it rattle snake and rabbit sausage it is! Hahaha we also order a small side of belgian fries with the chipotle sauce. Wait wasn't too bad, we came on a Tuesday night and there was no line at all but as I walk more into the restaurant it was pretty filled up with people. Plus they have a bar and some DJ stuff in the back. Probably on the weekends they may have an DJ? So if you're eating in the back just grab your number and go because they provide water, forks, knives, ketchup, mustard and other stuff in the back. We didn't know this so we got our waters and had to walk down the hall to grab a table. FOOD: So good! The rattlesnake/rabbit was really juicy. If you told me I was eating pork I would believe you because that's exactly how it taste. Plus you get two topping! Spicy jalapeños and grilled onion for the win yassss. The belgian fries though.. it's like an french fries and potato wedge had a baby ahahha SO good! Perfect potato in one bite don't forget to order these! OH and amazing choices of beers!!! See that gets three exclamation points because more the alcohol more the merrier. PARKING: PAIN IN THE BOTTOMS. But we were able to score a good parking space.. hopefully that happens again."

Condiments like spicy mustard, honey mustard, dijon mustard and ... well, ketchup, are freely shareable on the tables in the dining area. The communal tables are a nice option to sit at, but there's also an option for smaller tables if you'd like your privacy. Wurstkuche also has some of the best belgian fries. Always airy, crisp, and perfectly golden. ALWAYS orderFavorite sauces: Bleu cheese and BBQAlso, I find it amusing how there's a small DJ booth in the dining area but have never really seen a DJ.

They have a variety to choose from, and I love mixing and matching to get different flavors with my sausage. Their fries are pretty good (try the aiolis!), but I usually just stick to the sausages when I go.Wurstkuche always looks like it is too busy because of the line in the front entrance, but there's actually a ton of space hiding in the back!

It's just a little crispier because they double fry it and it's cut a little bigger than regular fries but smaller than potato wedges. But not bad! Their original bratwurst is really good.

The lines (while sometimes intimidating) can go pretty fast, so give the place a chance to impress you.I've never actually sat in to dine at the restaurant, I usually order a bunch of sausages for take out so I can wolf them down in the comforts of my own home. Anyways, if you're new to the sausage life, I recommend starting with the classic bratwurst and bockwurst. I've NEVER walked out of Wurstkuche without at least ordering 2 bratwursts. Simple, affordable and delicious. I'm still working my way down the menu, and have only tried a few of the exotic sausages. Out of the ones I DID try - the rabbit veal and rattlesnake sausages are pretty good. The Belgian fries are a nice accompaniment to the sausages, and the truffle aioli can hit a savory spot!"

Yeah some people are not into sausages, but I am half German and well its in my blood.I really enjoy coming here and for me, I always gotta get a rattlesnake brat when I come in. I have eaten snake a few times and this is a tasty way to have it as well. However they have a number of normal and abnormal sausages. You can find things like the aforementioned rattlesnake, as well as rabbit and other game meats. They also have a full array of normal beef chicken pork and veggie style sausages. Some of these include variations with srirracha sauce, various herbs and spices, and different types of peppers.You order at what is essentially a meat counter with a cooking window and a couple of beer taps and then head to the back where the seating area is on long communal benches or booths with a full bar. It's a slightly dark/dim atmosphere and is pleasant for spending some time with friends while munching on brats So in summation tasty and somewhat unique vittles, draft on tap, and good company if you bring it... what more do you want in a joint?

Also, the fact that they have a single cash register to take the order and pay for every order in this decently large establishment is quite disappointing.   Either open up a second register in the back, or give people a means to order and pay from their phone (Android/Iphone app), and let them just pick up a number from the front counter.The place has serious potential to become a 4 or 5 star place in my book, but due to the reasons I mentioned it is only 3 stars to me right now."

A staff came around and took our drink orders while we waited in line, and he recommended a few based on our preferences. We got the beers before we put in our orders, and they were delicious as one would expect from German beer. We got a healthy mix of exotic and classic sausages. It's definitely interesting tasting the different textures from the different meats. The pheasant tasted fairly meaty, rabbit was very gamey, Filipino was... Unique, the lamb was sweet. Definitely worth trying all of them for the novelty factor.Still, my favorites were the classics: Kielbasa and Bratwurst. So if you're hesitant about trying some of the more exotic flavors, then stick to the classics. You can't go wrong. As a final note, they pay great attention to detail to ensure the ambiance is great. Lighting is on the dim side so it's easy to focus on your group even though you're next to other people/tables. There's a DJ playing house tracks that adds to the vibe, and the decor is unique. The tables and chairs are custom shapes, and each type of beer has its own glass. Bottom Line: Worth trying some of the exotic meats for the novelty factor, and a great hangout place."

The owners now have added a second location in Venice and though not it's really walking distance to the boardwalk, it is still only a short drive away. The menu seems the same but I haven't been going long enough to know how much it may have changed.I recently ordered a Bratwurst Sausage with caramelized onions and sauerkraut and a glass of Floris Apple Ale. I would suggest ordering a side of Belgian fries that comes with curry ketchup and Chipotle Aioli. The fries are perfectly fried, very crispy outside but soft inside and dipping sauces are very unique and tasty. Can't help going back to try some of their exotic sausages. Would love to try the Alligator & Pork, Smoked Andouille Sausage; and Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers. You have to order your food and beer at the front entrance. After you order and find a place to sit, they will bring your food to the table. This place is quite popular and there is usually a wait in line to be expected. Finding a table/seats are challenging, even though they have a good number of seats. If you want to avoid the crowd, go there before 6 PM or go there after 9:30 PM.

There was a long line to get in but once you're sitting down you can go up to the bar and order as many beers as you want without waiting. The sausage was amazing! I am usually super bummed when I hear that there are sausages because every single time they are stuffed with meat. Not this time! This was the first sausage I've actually had and I'm super stoked about how amazing it was. Next time I won't get toppings though (peppers and onions) because I rather it be simple. Now for the fries. The fries were addicting and amazing. They were not exuding with grease which made them really great! They were thick and soft. I got the side of chipotle aoli to go with it. It was so tasty! Hands down one of the best aolis I've tried to date.

Wish I got to try them all.. =PMy gf got Chipotle aioli and sundries tomato ketchup and pesto mayoThe fries are double dipped/fried (?).. Fries were too salty for me.. Also, for you craft beer lovers, they offer German/Belgian beer! good selection too!Will come here for their beers!"

Aside from the fact that this is one of the most unique restuarants in LA, the flavors of the sausages are amazing. So flavorful and savory, and with a variety of spices not usually present in say, beef hot dogs.First timer, went with a group of friends and ordered the most exotic sausages on the menu, with the exeception of a few classics. We went with the rattlesnake, the pheasant, the rabbit, the chicken and apple with spices, and the mango jalepeno, what a mouthful. The pheasant was pleasantly savory, and went well with some onions, kraut, and honey mustard! The rabbit was a bit gamey for my taste, but objectively speaking, still good with the onions. Well the onions were good on everything.The fries were a nice addition to the meal, and I especially enjoyed the variety of sauces to dip them in! Naturally the pesto mayo was delicious, and so was the chipotle ketchup. All in all, great good, nice ambience, and a good variety of drinks as well, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic (mandarin orange jigger was odd at first, but a swig or two after a bite of sausage was really refreshing.)"

You get a sausage on a bun with a choice of two sides. Also, get the fries! They are the best I've had. I got the larger one, which comes with two choices of dipping sauce. Oh and I had a nice half liter franziskaner to go with it ;)Take your friends and go enjoy some awesome food."

Their dogs are certainly not simple ordinary hotdogs. There's exotic flavours and new meats that will raise some brows, but they delicious! They have a large variety of different kinds of dogs, that you can mix and match with the toppings. These with the fries and maybe a cold beer will make your night better.    Last time I came, I wanted to be a bit adventurous and try the rabbit and rattlesnake. It was surprisingly pretty tasty. You can surely tell a bit of a difference with meat, and the aftertaste, but I thoroughly enjoyed my brat. It's meaty and juicy. I got it with fries and an aioli dipping cause. There is also different kinds of mustard on your tables for your convenience. The initial entrance makes it look a bit small, as it is just a store front where you order your meal. Then you go through the long and narrow hallway to the dining area of the restaurant, which is pretty big.The staff is usually friendly, the only struggle is the parking in DTLA. Once you find parking, you wont have to worry about anything else. Plus there is a Pie Hole right next door, for a sweet treat after your savory meal."

At first glance it looks tiny, but walk down the narrow hallway by the register and you will find a large dining area and bar. There's outdoor seating as well. They have quite the extensive selection of sausages and beer aplenty. There's also vegetarian options, which makes this a great lunch spot for everyone. I had the mango jalapeño and my bf had the chicken apple and spices - both delicious. I liked how it was sweet with a little kick of spice. You can also choose caramelized onions, spicy peppers, or sauerkraut as toppings. If you're feeling adventurous, you can try some of the more exotic meats such as pheasant, rattlesnake, rabbit, etc. We also shared a side of the Belgian fries with Tzatziki (Greek yogurt) sauce and chipotle aioli sauce. Overall great food! I wasn't much of a fan of sausages before, but Wurstkuche has convinced me otherwise!"

In fact, as I am writing this, I'm upgrading them from 3 to 4 stars for the service...and the vanilla cream soda, which was super tasty! The fries, which we shared, were EXCELLENT. I went with kielbasa for my sausage, with grilled onions. Both my friends went with the vegetarian smoked apple sage. We all felt like, for a place where the sausages are the star, these sausages were good but not amazing. I'd go for a fritzi dog over a wurstkuche dog any day, for example. But, they have a ton of beer on tap and a great atmosphere and we thought it would be fun to go back and just chill on a weekend afternoon with \"beers and brats\" so to speak. Also, it's right across the street from Pie Hole, which is convenient ;) But, seriously, the Arts District is definitely an up and coming area of downtown, and Wurstkuche fits right in."

Its in the arts district with a lot of pretentious people walking around.  walked in and great customer service... ordered a Kielbasa dog and ask what IPA's and/or reds they had. Was told the selection was limited since they specialize in Belgians, wheats and pale ales.  I selected a beer with the most hops and sat at the bench. atmosphere was cool, but what I didn't like was the ability for people to bring in their small children in.  There were 3 parties, one with a 10 yr old and 2 with infants.  Just my luck, one of the infants started to cry and the parents ignored it while they drank beer.  Something really awful about getting your drink on while your infant child is screaming.  This place should not allow small children in. It's inappropriate to say the least.So, as I sat there drinking my beer and trying to tune out the crying baby, I had flashbacks of being in a Kindercare, but this time with a cold beer. I finished and walked to the long bar they had to order another beer since the child had calmed down.  I asked the waitress for recommendation. Settled on a beer with the name \"Hopp\" in it. forget what it was but it was tasty. I would go back just for that one beer.Finished and left... Pros.. good sausagesprice per dog is good ($6.50)long sit down tables were cool,fresh air with an open nearby doorCons:they allow children in the bar areacost of beer was a little high ($9.00)I would come back but only if I was in area"

I am  skeptical in general of all forms of mechanically separated meats. To paraphrase a quote from a famous black man, \"rat may taste like pumpkin pie but I wouldn't eat the motherf*cker.\"I stuck with the Kielbasa. It rocked. The fresh chewy bun, spicy meat, and crisp snap of the sausage casing was all money.  A-The bratwurst wasn't bad either. I would give it a B. The wedge fries were excellent. I typically don't like wedge fries as I find them too dry. But these were like mash potatoes on the inside and hyper crispy on the outside. AI was initially annoyed by the long line to order the food prior to sitting. But after some thought, I realized it cut down on the waiting time. There are  no unnecessary bottlenecks to idly wait for a table to open up. Its brilliant. Another plus is the huge octoberfest style dining room with the shared tables.  I am tempted to slam the mugs together and yell \"Prost!!\" Great place for sausage and beer."

This restaurant is located around the back of little Tokyo where umami, pie hole, etc, is. P A R K I N G:Parking is a hit or miss--sometimes it's really easy to find parking but I've also had to pay for $2 valet about a block away which isn't bad at all. I usually come around 6-7pm and never had to wait more than 10 minutes to order. However, I've walked by around 9-10pm (going to pie hole for dessert hehe), and the line extends beyond the door! F O O D:What's really special about this place are the sausages. They have many exotic flavors such as rabbit and rattle snake--makes me feel super adventurous when eating it, haha! But honestly, if you're afraid, it's sounds crazier than it actually is. You can definitely taste the differences between each type of sausage but overall every sausage is super duper delicious--my personal favorite is the rabbit. You have a choice of adding toppings such as onions and sour kraut onto your hot dog but honestly I am not a big fan of that stuff so I always just eat it as is. They have ketchup and several types of mustard on each table so have fun mixing and matching. Even though the hot dog fills you up pretty well I always order a side of small fries (usually to share with a friend) because their fries (MUST get the one with truffle oil) are DELICIOUS! It's perfectly crispy and thick--it's divine. You get to choose a dipping sauce and they have a very wide selectionm making it very hard to decide on one because I want to try multiple--my personal favorite is the chipotle aoli. They have a bar area at the back of the store which I have yet to try. They also sell a variety of European soft drinks--it's pretty much coke but in a glass bottle, triple the price, and taste a bit different. It's worth a try, but I personally wouldn't order it again cause I'm totally good with water. This place is great to hangout with friends and also for a casual date. I will definitely be coming back to this place again and again!"

They have a nice selection of gourmet sodas.I tried the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers, $8. It was mild tasting as advertised. Perhaps a tad too mild because I could not discern the taste. The sausage had a good snap when I bit into it and I enjoyed the smoky essence.Once the novelty of trying the exotic meats (up until that point, it was the first time I ate either rattlesnake or rabbit in any form) wore off, I quickly determined that it is best to stick with the classic bratwursts and hot links. Nothing, in my opinion, can match the juiciness, smokiness and succulent flavors of pork and beef.There will be a return visit at some point and I trust a higher evaluation will ensue after I try what Wurstkuche is primarily known for: the classic bratwurst and any number of imported beers on tap."

The line can get quite long, but it moves relatively fast.They have a large selection of beers (and also international drinks!) and various sausages and fries. I ended up going with the rattlesnake, feeling adventurous. It was really good but a lot more subtle in flavors than I expected. I definitely need to come back and try more of their sausages. More importantly, however, is their Belgian fries. After studying in Brussels, all I dreamed about every single day was eating Belgian fries and I have to say Wurstkuche does it perfectly. Not only do they make amazing fries but also have a bunch of dipping sauces (though they should add andalouse and brazil to make it even more Belgian!)The fries were definitely the most satisfying part of the meal. The long tables in the dinning area was really nice and definitely created a fun, inclusive, casual atmosphere. They were also playing like low-key turn up music which was cool.

It seems like they always have at least three vegetarian sausage options, and I've never been disappointed by any of them!I've had the Vegetarian Italian, Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sage, and the Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle and they are all great! My personal favorite is the apple sage because it's a little bit sweet a little bit savory, and it handles toppings really well. With any of the sausages that you order you get to pick two toppings (carmelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, spicy peppers) and unlimited mustards - the whole grain is awesome.And you guys, THE FRIES. Oh Lord I could write a whole novel on how delicious the fries here are. Crispy, piping hot, not dripping in grease...AND they have like a million different dipping sauces. I DIE. Just writing this post is making me crave the fries. And let's not forget the beer - awesome draft selection, especially of German and Belgian beers. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not super knowledgeable about beer, but the bartenders here are really friendly and will help you out if you have an idea of what you're looking for. As far as non-alcoholic beverages (pssh, really?) they DO have free cucumber water, which is super refreshing and delicious. The ambiance of this place is cool and fun, and there's always plenty of seating a their long \"mess-hall\" style tables and benches - I love that it's not stuffy at all. Parking can be a bit tricky since it's in the arts district, but if you drive around enough you're bound to find street parking sooner or later.

They have everything from your standard Brat, to Duck with Bacon and Jalapeno, to Rattlesnake, and the beer menu doesn't disappoint either. I have to admit, I was expecting exorbitant prices, but they are in fact quite reasonable. My wife and I each had a sausage, we split an order of large fries, and we both had beers for under $30. Not too bad, especially when you consider this place is in DTLA.If for some reason I'm back out that way, it's definitely a stop worth making."

The crowd looks like I was surrounded by lumberjacks - dudes with beards and flannels (not judging, of course ;). I ordered the rattlesnake and rabbit. This sausage was packed full of flavor. You could tell that the sausages are fresh. My only wish is that their buns didn't overpower the sausage. The dog to bun ratio is lacking.If it is busy, grab a beer. They have a wide beer selection. You'd be a fool if you skip out on their belgian fries. Fresh and crispy.This place is not just a place to eat, but to hang out and meet some cool people.For parking, good luck! Plenty of street parking. But, I'd go for a (paid) parking lot. When it's busy, there may be a line, but it is worth it. Come here for some great food, solid service, and to chill."

But its that good so its expected.I'm not really much of a hot dog person but these are pretty tasty...and so many options! I'm not a sausage connoisseur but I would say there is something for everyone....I've tried a couple... and every one was good but my fav is always the hot link....I love spicy everything so this was an obvious choice. Yum! You get to pick 2 free toppings from sweet peps/spicy peps/grilled onion/kraut... I usually go with the spicy peppers and either the onions of kraut depending on my mood...The fries here are BOMB (so gooooodddd). You pick a sauce with your order...cant go wrong with the chipotle mayo. I think I got the truffle oil on the fries once because I love truffle fries and it wasn't too noticeable even though it was more expensive... so eh I usually get the regular ones.Now beer wise... this place is my beer heaven... I don't like beer that much but when it comes to Belgian and German beers I adore them. Those are most of their selection so I am always a happy camper. My fav is St. Bernardus..try it! My advice is to come when its not busy to really enjoy the food... and come when its busy to drink their delicious beer..and maybe get food when your buzz can entertain you in line."

I've tried a few sausages and the Rattlesnake is the most unique. I sometimes get the sausage to go and head over to Angel City Brewery. Don't get me wrong, it is not that their beers suck (they are actually pretty darn good), its that its get crowded here!Overall, pretty good and unique spot. Lines are long but it moves fast.

While some places close up for the day, this spot stays open late. It tends to get crowded later into the night as options become limited.So why all the fuss over this spot, honestly cannot say it's bad. But dig that they offer exotic meats other than your plain pork or beef items.The interior of the spot is dimly lit perfect in case you don't want to pretty yourself up. ;) they have a good selection of beers and non-alcoholic drinks. Large seating area that has more of a bar atmosphere. The crowds it draws are quite loud and energetic. Wouldn't recommend for those seeking a more intimate ambiance. But hey it only lets you whisper in each others ear. Just make sure not spit in it or you'll lose points. Enjoyed my first visit and will eventually check out again, not a bad way to end the night."

So if you're planning on eating here before a game, schedule accordingly. I've only been here before games, but I heard during the night, it sure does get busy, and they have a DJ/band playing during the weekend. Food, as you may see they serve hot dogs! Yes delicious hot dogs with unique and exotic meats. They also have some of the most delicious french fries ever, and they serve beer! During my first visit, I went with the most exotic thing they had, rattle snake! The hot dog itself was really good. It definitely is not your regular hot dog. So many flavors, especially with the bell peppers it comes with. They also have bottles of different kinds of mustard, honey mustard, spicy brown mustard, you name it! They are all delicious. Price, like I said, these are not cheap. A meal for two, which would include  a hot dog, fries and a drink can easily add up to $40 or more! Which is why, it's good to come here once in a while. Service, is nothing sort of amazing. You wait in line, they ring you up, and they bring you your food. The wait is not to long. From the time you wait in line to the time you get your food is probably about 15 minutes. Ambiance, the location of this place almost feels like a hole in the wall if you are not familiar with the area. You can easily miss the small opening to the place, The only sign of the place would probably be the long line starting from the outside. The area where you order your food is a teeny tiny area, but once you walk to the back, the place opens up to tables and rows of tables for a cafeteria like seating, but with a hip style to it. More than likely, you will find a seat just fine.Overall, you have to check this place out at least once when in LA. The weekends I would say is the best time to go."

I've sworn to stay away from hot dogs 4 years ago after discovering what was actually put into those little meat sausages, but I broke my promise to myself after really craving a hot dog for some reason recently. I figured, if I'm breaking my four year long hot dog boycott, it better be good, and it better be, different. I didn't want your average Dodger dog. A friend of mine who's really into the food scene suggested this place a while back, and I always dismissed it. I figured, how fancy can hot dogs get?!Well, Wurstkuche really delivered on the \"different\" front. My chicken apple with onions hotdog  was delicious, and the truffle fries that came with it were well worth the 1 year they shaved off my life. It gets very busy here, so if you're making way over here, try not to come around lunch time (12:00-1:30pm)."

It's got some spice and a nice bite to it- Buffalo sausage: not gamey but very similar to beef. Tastes like a normal hot dog except for the fact it's not a normal hot dog- Duck/bacon sausage: my favorite. Very rich in flavor, oily, juicy, and smoky- Fries: order with curry ketchup and blue cheese walnut/bacon dip.Seating in the back indoor or outdoor, parking on the street or $10 for one of the lots, and located in a grungy artsy ghetto neighborhood filled with skinny jean wearing hipsters.

Everyone in our party seemed pretty satisfied with their hot dogs but not overly wowed. I think the best part was the convenient bar located near the tables which made it easy for everyone to keep a fresh beer handy. Hence the stars for being a good spot to grab a bite and hangout for a bit. I'm not sure I would crave to go back but I can imagine stopping in again if we're in the area.

A sausage house isn't exactly where you think to take your vegetarian friend but we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. All sausages range between $6-8. Vegetarian and classic options are the cheapest. They do a great job of keeping the consistency and flavor of veggie options on point w a normal sausage. Exotics are the most \"expensive\" which include sausages w rattlesnake, rabbit and other interesting meats. I ordered a vegetarian Italian with the intention of trying an exotic one if I was still hungry. One is more than enough, especially with an order of fries (which I split). I really enjoyed the chipotle dipping sauce. Beer selection is awesome but a little on the spendy side. Granted they are exotic beers, not your typical coors or bud. The sizes vary too. Both my strawberry and grapefruit beers were super delicious and priced about the same but one was practically a stein and the other was hardly as big as a martini. The grapefruit one was bigger. Communal type seating. Great service- it was cafeteria style w numbers but we still had 3 people come around to make sure everything was good. Great spot"

Take the back entrance if you're just there to order food, no need to go to the huge line. Back entrance is the door on the corner of the street. Enter and you see long tables and the bar. Head over to the bar and the beers are organized by type (German, Belgian, etc.). They were out of the beer I originally tried to order and the bartender was kind enough to let me sample other types based on what I was looking for. She was super friendly and left me with a darker beer than I intended but it had a crisp aftertaste. I would come back to try the food and enjoy another beer."

However, I haven't been back since until last week, and I was somewhat disappointed with what I had.I ordered the sundried tomato with mozzarella dog and chose two options of onions and sauerkraut. I also got a side of small fries with curry ketchup. When the food arrived, it looked and smelled delicious. However, it was only okay. The hot dog was a little dry and not as juicy as I expected, and the fries were good- nothing special though. I still really enjoy their options of sauce here; I love how there's a huge variety of mustard as well as sauces for the fries and hot dogs! My overall impression of this place was okay. I still love the environment and the long shared benches and tables, but the food was not as good as it used to be. I actually find Dog Haus more delicious than Wurstkuche."

The fries here are thick cut and have a lovely earthy flavor to them. They did inform me that the bun contains a dairy product so they served it on top of the 'kraut and peppers instead.

Well, I didn't go directly in, I had to wait in line for half an hour or so because everyone and their brother was there waiting for some sausage. But the staff was awesome and served us beer while we waited in line, yeah, I can deal with that! I got the snake and jalapeño, because it sounded dangerous and delectable all shoved into one large sausage. And it was! Holy hell I couldn't believe how good it was. The fries were legit too. I finished my meal and seriously considered going back for seconds, but I still had my extra delicious beer to finish, oh yeah I forgot about my beer because the deliciousness of the sausage blinded me from all else.The restaurant decor is cool too, fits well with the rest of the arts district, industrial, laid back, and filled with hipsters. The outdoor patio is cool too, which wraps the corner of the restaurant for extra seating.I will definitely go back because I must try every other sausage on the menu. So freaking good!"

I waited for about 10-20 min to order my food and the staff were attentive and friendly. The staff would come out to great their customers in line and offer them a menu to look at. The food selection is great therefore it makes it a tad bit hard to select what you want to eat/try, so order two or three.... I had the Louisiana hotlink and it was delicious.

We shared the Belgian fries Groot size with curry and chipotle ketchup and ended up being still hungry. Probably could have ordered another sausage to share and that would be a decent sized meal.They let you order beers to sip on while waiting in line, be sure to see which ones come in cool mugs! Zwick'l is the last one on the German beer list and that one comes in a tall ceramic mug. The Fruli stays true to its description and has a very distinct strawberry taste to it.The dining room and patio have plenty of space for you to eat, although it may be tough to sit a large party.

With eat dog, you pick two toppings (sweet peppers, sauerkraut, caramelized onions, etc). I chose sweet peppers and caramelized onions. I also ordered belgian fries with truffle oil (recommended by Yelpers). You chose two ketchup, so I got the curry ketchup. We had 10 other friends with us and seating wasn't too hard to find. I could see it being a nightmare though, since there's mainly a large picnic table in the middle of the room. The dog (topped with whole mustard), the fries, and the curry ketchup were just okay.

        "review": "A great casual spot for sausages, beer, and fries. You can usually find street parking nearby.Wurstkuche has a great vibe. You order at the front, then head down a little corridor to the back section where the seating is. Seating consists of a lot of long, communal benches as well as some side tables. The overall feel is dive-y, casual, and perfect for groups. When ordering, you get the option of 2 out of 4 toppings for your brat: caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers (bell peppers), and spicy peppers.SAUSAGES:My favorite of the ones I've tried so far is the Buffalo, Beef, and Pork w/Chipotle Peppers. It has a medium-heat, smokey spiciness and bold flavor. The Duck and Bacon w/Jalapeno Peppers is a close second, with a slightly more fatty taste. I've tried the Rattlesnake and Rabbit w/Jalapeno before and it just didn't stand out to me. That said, I think you're perfectly fine going with Classics ($6) or Gourmets ($7) rather than the pricier Exotics. They do well in spicing their sausages, and thus the spices stand out more than the actual meat. I have a couple vegetarian friends who rave about their vegetarian sausage options. My only complaint is that the sausages are pretty small for what you pay. Without a side order of fries or a beer, you definitely won't be full.BELGIAN FRIES + DIPPING SAUCES:I really think that Wurstkuche shines in their Belgian fries and dipping sauces, not so much their sausages. The small size includes one dipping sauce and is $3.50 and the large includes 2 dipping sauces and is $5.50. The large is good for sharing between 2-3 people, though they're so good you could probably devour an entire order yourself. The fries are thick-cut, always crispy on the outside, and perfect with the truffle glaze (though $2 extra for this is a bit pricey). Get the chipotle aioli dipping sauce! It's creamy and smokey and I can't get enough of it. Curry ketchup is another good option.I love Wurstkuche for its laid-back vibe and simple, tasty menu options. Go for the sausages, stay for the fries!"

I wouldn't have minded the texture if the sausage itself had more flavor. To me it tasted like a sweeter sausage with bits of Jalapeno chunks (that weren't spicy at all). Friend got the Rabbit & Rattlesnake Jalapeno, which wasn't bad. It was just the thought of the 2 combined that threw me off... Likeee did the rattlesnake eat the rabbit then they grinded them together??? Lol.The fries were not bad, I added the truffle sauce. I went again last week before the Zedd concert and had a much better experience though. The cashier suggested that I go with the \"Hot Italian\" and it was sooo dam good. It was basically what I expected the Mango &  Jalapeno sausage to taste like. That will definitely be my go to!"

The parking is outrageous, almost makes you not want to go- $10 or $7 flat rate (don't let the $2 and $3 lots full you - it means for every 10 mins not flat rate). Not worth it for a sausage hot dog- that's almost as much as one of their sausages. Try to find street parking if you're lucky enough because there are alot of businesses in that area. Heard the fries were pretty good, we tried chipotle aioli and bleu cheese bacon and walnut. The blue cheese, you can literally taste all those flavors and chipotle was good too but how you would imagine it to taste. Both were super creamy (not a huge fan of cream) so the fries tasted good with their ketchup as well. Ketchup is a little sweeter than heinz.We tried rattle snack and rabbit-very good and packed with flavor, tasted more gritty and earthy. Pleathen (spelling)- SUPER HERBY. Really good though, but after awhile tasted like dim sum dumplings. It is pretty pricy for the amount of food given but you will really have to appreciate the quality of the meat and the uniqueness!

It was chewy and tasted pretty good, but I couldn't really tell that I was eating anything special. The bell peppers were a nice touch though. Honestly this place seems a bit overpriced for what they're serving you, but I suppose you're paying for the 'exotic-ness.'  Also, there seemed to be plenty of seating, but be ready to wait in line for a bit especially if you come during peak hours. Lastly, and I've mentioned this before, traffic and parking in downtown LA sucks. It might not be worth it to make the drive all the way to downtown just for this, but if you're in the area then this place is worth a try at least once. You might as well also try the other nearby restaurants and enjoy the art district/little Tokyo while you're at it to make the drive and search for parking worth it."

I wondered if we should go to the bar, or would someone come up to take our order.  I saw someone who looked like they worked here, and she informed me we were in the dining area and that we needed to order at the front.  Apparently we had entered through the back door and in the process let it be known that it was our first time here.  The woman was very friendly and walked us to the front ordering area before running us through the menu and giving us recommendations.  There was a little bit of a line, so we had a good chance to go over the menu and figure out what we wanted.  I went with the Mango Jalapeño chicken-sausage and split a large order of fries.  I also ordered a Vitus, which is my favorite beer that I don't come across often.   My Mango Jalapeño chicken-sausage and fries were pretty good, but nothing special.  What stuck out most about my meal was how little the sausage was, and that I was still hungry afterwards. What really made my meal good though was being able to wash it down with a cold Vitus.Wurstkuche was pretty good.  I was expecting more because of all the things that I had heard about it, and maybe I held the place to too high of a standard.  It is not a place I would go to if I was super hungry, but I would come back for a small meal and a good beer. It was worthy of a visit and possibly a return trip.3.5 stars rounded up to 4"

He really liked the food here and we will probably be back. I tried the mango jalapeño and he had the Louisiana link and shared some fries. We did have two beers and I can't remember the names because they were German. The atmosphere is nice, there was a dj playing and the waitresses came by to ask if we were ok and to pick up our stuff. We paid $36 for two sausages, a large order of fries, and two beers. Somewhat pricey but we enjoyed it."

        "review": "An unexpected find in an area I don't frequently visit. From classic sausages like veal and pork to gourmet renditions of rattle snake and rabbit. Beer on tap, fries, mustard, and everything you need for a great evening with friends. Depending on where you enter the restaurant from it almost takes on two separate identities. From the one side, you got a long bar with plenty of seats, communal tables, and even an outdoor patio. From the other, a Dali style walk up with a glass refrigerator displaying all the tubular meats your heart desires. An open grill and a few taps behind the cash register. Of course both sides are intertwined, so regardless where you're coming from you'll find the need to navigate this mini maze. But hey, that's part of the fun. My order was prepared really quickly and brought to the table according to my number. The sausage was nicely made and had great flavor with the kind of texture you expect from veal. The dominant notes of coriander and caraway rounded out the taste. I would say that my favorite part is the simplicity of toppings. Just a few to choose from and all will only compliment your selection, not detract from it. So grab a wiener, chug a beer, and enjoy!"

Here's several:- Buffalo - Duck- Rattlesnake- Rabbit- PheasantThey should have more places like this! Tip:- Entrance is sort of weird. It's not located on the corner of the street but on the side. If you happen to enter through the back (corner entrance) and only see the bar and tables, head toward the back down a small hallway. You will see a small register and probably a long line of hungry customers. - A lot of murals and art in the area (Makes sense bc you're in the middle of the Arts District)- Hipster vibes"

        "review": "For the contemporary hipster who wants to have a fancy sausage lunch and beer, this is exactly the place to go downtown. It's an order at the counter and have your sausage brought out to you sort of place. And, it boasts a wide variety of sausage and beer options (including vegetarian and rattlesnake), so it's kinda cool. And, the seating area is cool--adult picnic tables with a choice of mustards and ketchup. But, for me, I wasn't overly impressed. I did get the veggie (the Italian one), and there's only so much you can do to vegetarian ingredients to make them \"meaty\", but I found it to have WAY too much oregano or some other Italian seasoning. The first bite was good, but after that it was quite overwhelming. Thankfully my co-eater shared his fries, which were actually pretty amazing--thick cut and yet somewhat crispy and tasting truly wholesome (as potatoes go)--4.5 stars. Bottom line: If this is your kind of food, you'll love it. Just be prepared for the hipster price tag. Hipsters are no longer starving artists living in SoHo and writing poetry with Allen Ginsberg; they are the offbeat yuppie with disposable income for fancy beer and sausage served at indoor picnic tables."

We literally just placed our order, sat down and ordered drinks. He had nothing to drink and the fact that we had to prove it was ridiculous. No one should treat another person this way and act on race. Because of this I won't be coming back here. No food is worth feeling like shit while being in this establishment."

But you can't hate em for being popular. Today I had time to wait and it really didn't take all that long.Great variety of sausage and beer. I got the duck bacon sausage. It was delicious, although there wasn't an overwhelmingly noticeable flavor of duck, or bacon but rather an overall delicious flavor that included the bun and the toppings. It was pretty filling, and the sausages were fairly priced as compared to similar restaurants. I was impressed by the beer selection but even more impressed by the fact that they attempt to give you the perfect glass for every beer, whether it be by shape, or label or both. All the workers I dealt with were friendly and helpful. I would definitely return if I am in the neighborhood."

The bearded guy was really friendly & accommodating, helping you to maneuveur & order with food & drink.  Then the cashier tallies the order, you pay. They give you a metal numbered tag to place on the table you found to plant your behind. A runner finds your number & gives you the order.  I ordered the duck & bacon wuerst, & a friend ordered the rattlesnake & rabbit with Sauerkraut, pickled jalapenos.  The duck was cooked rather well-done & the meat texture was hard. I could barely sense the bacon. There was not even a slight gamy, wild taste of duck.The rattlesnake & rabbit was more delicately cooked to a medium so the texture was more moist, meaty.  However, the meat could be almost any meat since there was no real discernable taste difference.  The spicing was more of a factor in the light flavour than the meat itself.  This combination of meat is misleading since it could be a separate mixture of rabbit & rattlesnake, but it could also be rattlesnake that had eaten a rabbit.  In which case, the rabbit would just be an after thought.  The bearded, friendly wolverine/bear guy suggested a cucumber drink or the Elderflower drink to pair with the Rattle snake & Rabbit as well as the Duck & bacon.  The elderberry is like a bubble up with a slightly creamy feel.  You saunter through a long hallway with restroom conveniently along the way which opens up to a huge space with picnic-like HARD wooden table guaranteed to hurt your rear-end if you sit too long.  There is also a sizable private room offset from the mess hall.    This is not earth-shaking food that will change your life.  It's more like comfort food indirectly via some imaginary Hofbraeuhaus, Muenchen, Deutschland.  3- Yelp stars.  Guten Appetit und Prosit!"

I'm born and raised in Germany so yes I know what I'm talking about. This is just a nice hipster vintage retro place made for the younger crowd making it even more attractive to packaging and sell it as a German place.Believe me. It's American food you get here. Only Sauerkraut and a bunch of different sausages doesn't make it German. Still, the vibe is really nice. I love this area in Downtown with this hipster kind of feel. People wait at Wurstküche in line, get their order and of course beer. (They really should serve German beer only to justify its name).I had an overall great experience. But as a German customer I wish for more authenticity. Maybe all real German servers and more German beer."

Once you are inside they give you a menu, take your drink order and with the counter around the side, you can drink and visit with others in line while waiting to place your order.  When it is almost your turn they come back ask if you have questions, explain the toppings and by the time you reach the counter, You can place your order and go. I liked that, all places should have that rule. If you are waiting in line for 10 minutes. Figure out what you want while waiting, not once you get to the counter. Had the rattlesnake and rabbit was very good, also tried the one with duck again very well seasoned. Once you order your food you go to the back and find a seat. Great staff had a few come up and ask how everything was. Excellent place to grab a beer and a bite."

You go inside order your food and there are seats in the back where you take your number and they bring your food to you. My only complaint is that when I ordered the buffalo, what I didnt like was that when my hot dog came, the sausage filled up only half the bun and I was left with just alot of bread. I asked the waiter if this was normal and he said that the buffalo sausage usually tends to shrink. I really wished there was a disclaimer when I ordered it instead of ordering it and being served a sausage that was half the bun........"

Warning: If you can't handle spicy don't get that option, it's practically a whole grilled jalapeno sliced and dumped on top. The acoustics for the dining area is not optimal, but hey the cafeteria style tables are hipster chic. If you're not imbibing beer, the cucumber flavored water is a refreshing option. The classic bratwurst is what I usually go for since it's on their cheaper end and just as tasty as their other exotic options.

If so, you should visit Wurstkuche (\"kuche\" means \"kitchen\" in German) in the Arts District of Downtown LA.You can opt to pay for parking across the street, or try your luck in finding street parking. Once you've passed that first hurdle, there's usually a nice long line here during lunch and dinner. During this time, you'll want to start making up your mind as to which sausage and beer you'd like to have.They have a variety of meats (the pictures do more justice than me describing it), but things like rabbit and rattlesnake are common. There's also different sausages fused or injected with different spices or sauces like the duck bacon jalapeno sausage (which I had during my visit here. Highly recommended). I also ordered a side of the Belgian fries, but found it was only okay. You'll definitely want to save more room for the sausages more than the fries.Knowing that their patrons are probably getting thirsty standing in line, the staff usually tries to get your drink order well ahead of you making your food order. I had a Blanche de Bruxelles beer to go along with my two wursts in my last visit and just about finished it by the time I paid for my order.Once determining and paying for your items, you're given a table number and you proceed to the dining room or patio. There, you can order more beer and find a seat to enjoy the food. There are water stations in the rear for those avoiding beer or trying to be a good designated driver for the group.The interior reminds me more of a typical German Oktoberfest set up, complete with long wooden benches and shared tables. Even if you come by yourself (and there is nothing wrong with that!), you can definitely find something to talk about with your neighbors regarding the exotic food. As you know, there's no better conversation starter than \"Is that rattlesnake?\""

The sweet peppers and onions were a perfect addition.  It is a fun place. Also love the location. It is an area of Los Angeles that is being is being refurbished.  The only comment I would make is the ordering can be a wait.Will definitely be going again."

So many sausage to choose from, ;) My friends speak highly of the rattlesnake & rabbit sausage because it is very flavorful but I stick to my faves:Mango jalapeno (chicken/turkey, sweet + spicy)Austin Blues (when I want something hot & spicy)Sun dried tomato and mozzarella (chicken/turkey, and I love sun dried & mozz)Filipino maharlika (sweet & filipino just like me ;) lol)Choice of 2 toppings: sweet peppers, spicy peppers, sauerkraut, carmelized onions.The fries with truffle oil are an absolute must. THIS IS KEY. TRUFFLE. OIL. And you choose sauce (1 for a small and 2 for a large). I love the chipotle aioli. BEER ME.Walk in, get in line, see the display of sausage, read through the menu, order your sausage, grab a number. Head down the skinny hallway and take a seat in the most hipster cafeteria setting ever. I dig it. OH, try to snag a table where all the mustard is located. The whole grain & honey are on point!"

I doused every bite with thick grainy mustard and savored the deliciousness.  The fries were good but not great; they were thicker crunchy fries, double-fried as I understand it and I did not see nor taste any truffle oil. I would skip this next time in lieu of sharing another sausage. So for amazing sausages in a trendy/cool location with a cool vibe, Yay! I'm a fan!"

Pro- tip: But the line for the ordering area is on Traction.If you come in the wrong door later in the day, the eating area is very dimly lit.Again, is that part of the charm?The aisle are not very wide table length-wise.  Only one person can walk comfortably.Hard to tell who works there or not.  But after seeing a guy bus a table, I ask him where do I go to order food, based on reading the reviews.He tells me to go down the hallway to the counter.I make my way to the counter.  Yes, it is well lit.  Hmmm.The line snakes along the triangular spaced entrance and out into the nighttime cold.  They have staff working the line.They herd us like cattle with these commands:Stand along the wall.  Move over.  Squeeze together.  Would you like a drink?Our credit card machine is working slowly.  We are out of Hot Italian and Louisiana Hot Link ( I think).I am not sure how to interpret slowly working.  Is it sick?  Still recovering from NYE?  They of course accept cash.  Cash is king.  Or so they say.  Idioms. They were offering samples of the Austin Blues to compensate for our extra long wait time and for the slowly working credit card machine.After 15-20 mins, we finally reach the front of the line.We order two dogs, Austin Blues with onions and sweet peppers.I wanted the Hot Italian but had to settle with Brockworst.  Based on the counter, they had tons of sausages. Is Hot Italian that popular?We grab a table.  My guest did not want to partake in the communal table space.We sit in the dark waiting/hoping that the server can see our number.Finally, someone brings our food.  Yeah.Here is my pic of my hot dog: yelp.com/biz_photos/wurs…I grab some of the fries.  Hoping to enjoy the Bleu Cheese Walnut & Baconthat everyone seems to rave about.  Yuck my fries are semi-warm.I spend some time trying to locate someone to flag down.After a bit, I decide to walk back to the counter.As I approach, I ask a guy if he works here.  Yes, he replies.I mention that my fries were luke-warm.  Nothing.  Just a blank stare.Hmmm.  Now annoyed, I ask for 2 to-go containers.He grabs some stuff, turns around, and hands it to me.I walk down that long dark hallway back to the dining area.I am thinking what a waste.  Where is the customer service?I noticed on how they had fries just sitting next to the fryer.  No wonder they were luke-warm.  I guess that they can mess up a simple thing like fries.They could have easily replaced my fries and made me a happy camper.Mess with my starch?  My fries?  Honestly, that was my main reason for coming.I wanted to taste their Belgium fries with their sauces.  But alas, this was not meant to be.Maybe I should have gone to their Venice location.Maybe they were so focused on their credit card machine not working.Tainted view of this place?  Maybe. Slightly.  Okay, yes.This review was written when I got back.  So definitely.Overall, hard to locate.  They blew simple customer service 101.I would not recommend this place due to the bitter taste of lack of service.Will my review affect their business, probably not.Will it affect me spending anymore money at this place, yes.I am tossing and turning in my bed as I lust for fries."

You order up in the front and then head down the alley into the back area where there's picnic tables all around and beer on tap too! It gets pretty loud in here, but that's what you expect for a spot serving nothing but beer and bratwurst. They have very exotic and interesting types of hot dogs, so be adventurous. I usually order the mango jalepeno ($8) with grilled onions and spicy peppers. You also can choose from sweet peppers and sauerkraut as your toppings. My friend and I also shared a large order of the fries ($5). These fries are a must as they're a thick and crispy cut. It comes with a choice of dipping (one for small; two for large). We got the chipotle aioli and buttermilk ranch. I like the taste of each, but you also have a variety of mustards and ketchup on the tables for free. Their honey mustard is also very good with the fries and hotdogs, so try a little bit of everything for your fitting."

My personal favorites are the Louisiana Hot Link and Hot Italian. They have just the right amount of spice while retaining the juicy flavor. Add some of their tasty Belgian fries along with a cold one and you're good to go.Another major plus is that Wurstkuche's sausages don't leave you feeling too heavy afterwards. I wish their sausages were just a tad bigger and a little more loaded on the toppings such as peppers and onions, but that's pretty minor in the grand scheme of things.I suggest going on a sunny weekend afternoon as it's not too crowded and you can enjoy the patio."

It's like walking into a rooftop lounge or busy college pub with lots of conversations, DJ playing good music, and top notch German sausages with imported beers. The unique thing here is that you can order and sip a beer while standing in line! Thats legit. I had a German IPA that was fresh and bitter tasting but was enough to get me on. Pretty expensive for $8 a glass though but once again, they are imports. I ordered the rabbit-rattlesnake sausage which was gamey, tasted like chicken, and had this roasted peppery taste. This was one of the most exotic things I've ever tried and what better way to have it in a hot dog form. This is a great place for friends and family; a group. The experience is great! You can mingle and meet new people around you. I recommend coming here around midnight or close to that time because it's live and people come to drink and have fun.I'll def be coming back for more! I'll always have to make a pit-stop here for sure at late nights during my stays in LA."

I have yet to try most of their sausages but I really enjoyed the mango jalapeno, chicken and apple, and the most famous rattlesnake.

Wasn't packed at all and had plenty of open seating available (cafeteria style)Tried the Rattlesnake & Rabbit.. Man that sausage was freakin good! Mildly spicy, juicy and just pure perfection. For the toppings, I went the caramelized onions and jalapeños just for an extra kick of spice. Along with the sausage, I had the Belgian fries cooked in white truffle oil glaze. YUM! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are plenty of dipping sauces to choose from but since I'm such a huge ketchup fan, I just stuck with the regular ketchup. However, I did try the chipotle aioli & curry ketchup and thise two sauces seem to be the most popular. Nice large inexpensive selection of beer on tap so there will definitely be something for everyone to love. Brats, fries, beer, and hip ambiance...what more could one ask for?!"

These are in the exotics section, which is probably the only section I would order out of since the prices are pretty expensive.....I just get the best one.

I love the homey, yet trendy, vibe of this hot dog establishment. They've got the gourmet sausage business down to an art. You can find everything from simple tasty bratwurst to exotic pheasant or alligator dogs. I've yet to try something I didn't love (though I haven't tried the veggie dogs yet - but my cousin did and said they were awe-some, so that sorta counts). Anyway, I love everything here from the options of toppings (caramelized onions belong on everything, in my opinion) and the myriad of sauces you can choose from (including an all-you-can handle sized squirt-bottle of almost every kind of mustard imaginable. Oh, and before I forget, let's discuss the FRIES. I don't know which divine creature makes its way down from the heavens to make these bad boys, but the fries here are TOO GOOD! I literally have to throw them at passers by so I don't eat them all myself (can't gain all them calories). So basically what I'm saying is go here ... order anything (you'll like it) and don't forget the fries.

The \"exotic\" dogs -- namely the Rattlesnake/Bacon or Duck/Bacon sausages only taste marginally different from a regular dirty dog. Given the fact that lines can extend up to 30 min+, definitely not worth the wait. No wait? It's a great place to grab a quick, albeit expensive, bite. I appreciate how Japadog and Seoul Sausage get creative with their toppings to jazz it up quite a bit, but here it's limited to peppers, onions, sauerkraut.Admittedly, the other sausages are top-notch. I enjoyed the spiciness of the Austin. The belgian fries are also on-point -- perfectly golden brown, crispy, and so thick it's like eating a fry with mashed potatoes inside. The beer selection is sizeable with a focus on Belgians and German beers, and these glasses are enormous."

SHEESHHhhhhhh.  Well, some quick pointers because you've got about 6k minus one reviews to go.  Order at the counter, they give you a number, find a seat and wait for your food.  Lots of hot dog/sausage options.  I like the Filipino Maharlika.  I thought it would be sweet like a Longaniza sausage.  But it was pretty good despite not conforming to my expectation.  Beer is pricey, but they have imported German/Euro beer.  Last time I was here I ordered food and went to Angels City down the street for a brew.  Parking isn't too bad, but you might have to circle around for a free spot, otherwise you can pay a couple bucks for lot parking.  Seating was similar to a huge cafeteria set up.  I felt like a kid again trying to find a good spot.  With the cafeteria seating it gets loud with all the noise, and if you come in the evenings they play super loud music.  Maybe I am getting old, but I'm not too fond of the loud music and yelling while my mouth is stuffed with food."

But I guess that's a given for a place that sells wieners.Wurstkuche, which is pronounced \"voost-ku-sha\" (according to the workers) or \"worst coochie\" (according to fellow Yelpers), is a fun little hipster-y sausage joint in the Arts District. That sounded kind of weird... let me explain.If you like sausages, you will like Wurstkuche. Okay, that sounded even weirder. Let's try again.Wurstkuche has a large variety of regular and exotic sausages. Ugh. Anyway.They have everything from mango jalapeno to rattlesnake and rabbit flavored sausages. They also offer a nice selection of Belgian and German beers, none of which I was familiar with. I wasn't feeling very adventurous during my visit, so I stuck to the mango jalapeno with caramelized onions and spicy peppers and a goblet of the La Chouffe. The total came out to around $15.There is a huge poorly-lit room in the back of the place that has cafeteria-style seating and a bar. You'll find bottles of ketchup, mustard, and other condiments on the tables for your enjoyment. The food comes out fairly fast, even when there are long lines - I believe my hot dog was in front of me in 5-10 minutes. Yay!The sausage itself was alright... I thought it was a little salty and I didn't really taste any mango in it. The beer was pretty good. However, what stuck out to me was their fries. THEIR FRIES ARE DELICIOUS! My friend got them truffle-glazed and DAMN. Thick-cut and perfectly fried with a chipotle aioli dipping sauce. I ended up devouring half of the entire thing.I may come back just to order two large fries and 10 dipping sauces. Maybe an exotic sausage if I'm feeling it."

But when I want to eat a hot dog, I come here :PAlthough I have heard of this place from several  friends, I didn't go here until my first time this summer. What's great about this place is that it's vegetarian friendly (I use to be a pescatarian and was one when I first came here). So I have had both the vegetarian options and the meat ones. The Chipotle Vegetarian is pretty damn good 4.5/5 stars. I like spicy and this dog is spicy. The Filipino dog: Okay, let's keep it real. I HAD to try this one especially that I am Filipino. It is a sweet pork and just as sweet as regular longinisas (Filipino sausage) I like. If only I had a fried egg and rice, I would have eaten this dog sans the bun. Not so bad, not so bad 4/5 stars. Fries: pretty legit I must say. Whenever I eat here and eat only the dog, I feel less fulfilled but these fries will help fill you up. As far as toppings, there is a select few. I always opt for the caramelized onions and the sweet peppers. And with sauces, there's a bunch of squirt bottles with all your needs: ketchup, mustard, honey mustard, whole grain mustard, and the list goes on and on. Environment itself is pretty cool. I always like the old school hip hop music they play. Sometimes there's a DJ indoors which is cool. There's also an outdoor seating area, meaning, this place is dog friendly. Yay for me and my furry friend :)"

Nancy had the duck and bacon with jalapeno peppers, while I chose the rabbit, veal and pork in white wine. We also decided to split an order of fries. The fries were tasty and you were able to select to condiments to accompany it.  We went with a  sun dried tomato sauce and buttermilk ranch.  How can you go wrong with either?  I thought the taste of the sausages was pretty good but not mind blowing.  My biggest gripe is that I wish the sausages were bigger.  Next time I would opt for a small or no fries in favor of a 2nd sausage. There is a bar in back of this restaurant which is situated on an odd corner...like a little triangle.   You order in front which has minimum seating but there is more seating in the back. Price wise its ok...I get it for the \"rarity\" of what they're offering.  However, if you're looking for bang for your don't count on it.  You'll be hungry later after dropping some cash at this spot.

The line was out the door. Check. Spot must be worth the wait/good. LA = can't rush anything. I'm learning. Heard this place had a mean sausage / hotdog thing and it was pretty good. Other than the wait, which took about 45 minutes, everything else was great. I ordered one of their exotic sausages: rattlesnack and pork. I got caramelized onions and spicy peppers. It was really good. The sausage was cooked with just a thin layer of crispiness, and the vegetables really brought out the flavors. I wanted to try the begian fries but I was too full. Really this place gets their novelty because of their exotic meats I think. To be quite honest, the sausage just tasted like sausage. I guess that's a good thing? I certainly didn't taste any rattlesnake.. Not that I know what that would've tasted like before, but I've heard it tastes like chicken. I really liked the bun, yeah I know weird. The bun was not a hotdog bun but it was like a roll. Really had a nice touch to it. Next time, I will try their beers and belgian fries. When you walk in to order, it looks pretty small. They have cucumber water for customers which is a nice touch. They have a lot of beers. I didn't try any cause I had my fair share but it's a great spot for some European/German/Belgian/etc. beers. You initially think it's a pretty small spot but when you walk towards the back, it's pretty big. You can fit what looked like 50 people, possibly more. They have a DJ and the ambience is just great. Apparently, it's a family restaurant. There's some outdoor seating as well which is just fabulous. Overall, I think a 4 is fair. The sausage tasted like sausage. I didn't try anything else so I can't even comment on that - but I'm sure I would've enjoyed it. However, I do believe everyone should check out this place if you're in downtown LA."

        "review": "Wurstkuche is a HUGE sausage indoor/outdoor sausage stand at 3rd Street and Traction. Entering from Traction, you order your sausage at the counter (after waiting in the ENORMOUS line), which is then called out back in the dining room. After walking down the hallway, you enter a huge open room with a long bar and incredibly loud music. Generally speaking, they have long lacquered picnic tables and benches for communal dining. There are a few smaller tables around the edge of the room and on the outdoor patio. This is a place for young people and not a place for those over 30ish or for children.Because we had a big group, we had the opportunity to taste SIX different sausages (which range from $6 to $8) which are served on an ordinary oversized hot dog bun. Generally, each sausage has a crisp casing and a juicy interior (except the vegetarian Italian, which is pretty dry). When you order your sausage, you pick two toppings - caramelized onions, sweet peppers, jalapenos or sauerkraut. I skip the jalapenos (I prefer the spicy sausages which have enough heat on their own) and the sauerkraut (not my fav). Because I want A LOT of onion, I generally order double onions, but the sweet mix of cooked yellow and red bell peppers are good too. We had:Bratwurst - classic pork sausage that is mild flavored. Very good staple.Vegetarian Italian - an interesting sausage that I think is grain based and is seasoned with fennel, garlic and roasted red bell peppers (little bits). If you are a vegetarian, this is a great meat substitute. If you are a meat fan, this is not a great substitute. It is really seasoned filler.Mango Jalapeno - this was one of the two BEST sausages that we had. It is made from chicken and turkey, so it is juicy without being very heavy, and it is very flavorful, sweet and spicy.Buffalo Beef with Pork - this excellent lean meaty sausage is seasoned with chipotle, which gives it a smoky flavor. This was the other of the two BEST.Duck - this was definitely a very close third before the two that were tied for first place. A richly flavored sausage that was not overly greasy with a little heat (there is much more jalapeno in the mango sausage). I could not discern any bacon flavor, but it is very good.Snake/Rabbit - this is a very good sausage but it is REALLY rich. I was surprised that snake and rabbit was much richer than the duck. I would say that the heat profile is the same as the duck - pretty mild.Other than sausages, they offer French fries with a variety of dipping sauces. I don't eat potatoes, so I skip these. They are very popular. There is also a plentiful beer selection. I had a sip of a dark beer that was good.Overall, it's like Oktoberfest year round here - sausages, fries and beer amid a constant racket with lots of young people and communal dining. If that's your thing, this is the place to be. For me, it's okay if I am in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip."

They also offer plenty of condiments on each table.  As for the location, since its in DTLA parking around here kind of suck.  But that's not their fault.  For the actual place, its broken up into two sides.  The larger room is the seating and bar area connected by a back narrow alley to the smaller food ordering room.  You place your food orders from the smaller room, and take the \"number sign\" and place it on your table and wait for your food.  Both rooms have entrances but the entrance to the larger room is kind of hidden from outside and can be hard to find.  There's no signs outside the door, its just a giant wooden door at the corner of the street.  If you're trying to look for it, its diagonally opposite from Angel City Brewery."

Located near Jtown, be prepared to pray to the parking Gods to find street parking, if not you can always pay for the lot which is a total rip off IMO.  We came here for a Tastemade event and got a gift card for $18 to spend. Anyways, we came on a Monday and it was still pretty packed, I can only imagine how busy it can get during a weekend. The food will come out slow since the grill is only the size of a small table so be prepared to wait a bit. They do offer complementary water while you wait though you may want to get one to get one of their many beers that they have on tap. You can pick from a wide variety of different sausages, the highlights being the exotic ones which are $8 each. I got the rabbit and veal combination. They also offer up a list of beers varying from many different IPA's though they were out of the one I wanted to try sadly so I ended up getting the Duchesse De Bourtgogne.There is a large seating area inside as well as outside seating. The inside seating is very dark so I suggest sitting outside where there is more light as well being able to experience the nice air at night.Overall the experience was decent though if it were up to me I would still prefer dog haus over this place since dog haus caters more to my tastes and has tater tots!!"

Almost 6,000 reviews?! The Yelp Elite in me KNEW that I had to take a trip out to DTLA to try this place out! Sadly, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be =/Fortunately the bratwursts were cheaper than I thought they would be, but I ended up spending almost $20 because I got fries with truffle oil, and an orange jigger as well. I was torn between four of their brats, so one of the guys working there recommended the Filipino Maharlika because it had a nice sweet flavor. I was curious to try this one because I'm Filipino, and wanted to compare it to what I've had in the past. My friend got the chicken apple? brat. The brats come with your choice of 2 of the 4 toppings, but I only got mine with onions because I refuse to eat sauerkraut.The brats were really unimpressive! The flavor of my brat alone was not that great at all... My friend commented and said they tasted like normal bratwursts that you could probably pick up at the grocery store and cook yourself. I know Wurstkuche is known for having exotic bratwursts like alligator, rabbit, etc...but I was not about to be that adventurous. Sadly I was disappointed by my Filipino Maharlika as it didn't really resemble what I remember eating growing up. Also, I felt like because I didn't put any sauce (mustard/ketchup) on my hot dog, it was really dry. I wasn't a huge fan of the hot dog buns they had which were kind of bland and dry...so that was a letdown altogether. My orange jigger was strange. It wasn't what I was expecting, and I felt like I was drinking a hard cider even though I was expecting it to be more like orange cream soda. Kinda disappointing!The reason why I would ever return back to Wurstkuche is because of their FRIES. Holy. fricking. crap. I think their fries may be quite possibly the BEST fries I have ever had in my life. And that's a pretty big statement for me to say because I've had a lot of french fries in my life. My friend and I were blown away by how good their fries were! AND they have a variety of dipping sauces to choose from, which is super awesome! The cashier recommended the pesto mayo to me, and I REALLY enjoyed it! It was absolutely perfect and paired really well with the fries. The only thing is I regret getting mine with truffle oil. I paid $2 extra for the truffle oil and it wasn't really noticeable. If I hadn't known there was truffle oil on it, I probably wouldn't have recognized it. Waste of $2! But still...man....my mouth is literally watering just thinking about those heavenly fries... *drools*Overall, I was a tad bit disappointed with Wurstkuche, but I'm glad that I found one thing I LOVED on their menu - THE FRIES! If I were to ever return, I would probably just order a large order of fries and call it a day. Maybe I'll try another brat...but with what I've had so far, I wasn't super impressed. 3 stars, but an extra 0.5 for the amazing fries :)"

I ordered the duck and bacon sausage while my friend ordered the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage; we both shared an order of fries with a side of curry ketchup.Verdict: the sausages were okay, a bit pricey for my taste. I definitely enjoyed the duck and bacon sausage more than the bite of the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage my friend ordered. The fries, however, were superb. Seriously, reminded me of Berlin (ich vermisse sie), and the curry ketchup was not bad. I would come here again and give the bratwurst a shot. Had the Franziskaner beer, which I usually enjoy, but wish there were other German beers, such as Paulaner.The atmosphere was a bit hipster, very casual, loud, dimly lit, etc - not a bad vibe at all."

The location is quite interesting, you walk in and its a deli style counter, but as you turn the corner it turns into a little mini club type of dining area with a DJ and a bar. So after you snag your alligator and veal sausages you chill and drink while a DJ spins, very cool. As far as the food goes all the sausages here are great, I don't remember all the ones that I tried but I know I enjoyed the one with the alligator. They put onions and peppers on it as well which are really good. Also the fries here are good."

Probably because I had just gotten out of Angel City Brewery, nonetheless I finally made it. I've heard about it over the years and have also read about it.  I believe it was on a Friday or Saturday night that I was there. The line was out the door. Usually a good sign when there's a wait. I tried their duck and bacon, rattle snake and rabbit and their buffalo pork and beef sausage. They were all very good. Maybe it's just my taste buds but they all taste almost the same. I guess when you've had one sausage you've had them all, right!?!? Jk jk.. but in all seriousness it was pretty good. I enjoyed the duck and bacon the most. Selection of German Beers were awesome. The only thing that I didn't like was the LOUD house music they were playing. I wasn't sure if I was suppose to be eating or 'popping some pills' and dancing. I was tempted to bringing out my glow Sticks but managed to restrain myself. I will be back though for sure.. I'm not sure if I will be eating or dancing next time I show up."

For all the hype around Wurstküche, I was sorely disappointed. There's definitely a certain type of über cool patron who frequents Wurstküche, but I just really don't get it. To me, it's just like Rosamunde in the Mission in San Francisco, and I don't get that place either. Yes, who doesn't love beer on tap, but the sausages left a lot to be desired. I tried the Bratwurst with kraut and onions. There was nothing special about it. Although, the fries were pretty decent. Put bluntly, the food just wasn't all that great.  I can see the appeal because it's a nice space with high ceilings and angular tables, but if the food isn't good, then there's just no point."

Try anything they have, I bet you it's good. Can't say that for too many places. Service is friendly, and surprisingly efficient. We even had a crazy guy making a commotion inside that was dealt with really well by the staff. If it's your first time here, do yourself a favor and try something different. Last time we tried the Austin Blues and Duck & Bacon dogs. AB was not what I'd call spicy, but it was definitely a solid middle ground type taste. The D&B however, was pretty freaking good. The fries are amazing so don't hesitate. They have a ton of great dipping sauces, or some hipster ketchup if nothing strikes your fancy. Negatives.. Well, parking is becoming more of a pain as time goes on. There is a $2 lot, and street parking - but it was feeling cramped the last time I visited. That was on a Wednesday night too. Then there's the price. If you feel like having a beer, small fries, and a hot dog - you're out a minimum of 17.50. That's without even figuring out what rattle snakes taste like or if white truffle oil glaze is worth it. Great spot for a night out with friends, or to get wasted and debate the merits of that stupid Steve Nash trade."

Order at the meat counter in front and then realize the place is larger as it seemed while waiting in line. Take your number to a communal table (or smaller one if you're lucky) and wait for your sausage to arrive.What I've tried:Austin blues- The fiancé had this and I was able to try it. Good snap and spicy flavor. Wish I had ordered this one.Vegetarian Chipotle- spicy and good chipotle flavor. I decided that being a vegetarian wasn't for me, but this would be a good substitute if I didn't have a choice. The texture was a bit off, but of course I was comparing to my fiance's Austin Blues.Filipino Maharlika- tried this on a previous visit and it wasn't too memorable. I of course had to try it though as  Filipino myself.Belgian Fries- this is a must! And the curry ketchup is amazing!The only reason I'd come back is to take curious visitors. I probably wouldn't request this place up front due to the wait and many options LA has to offer."

Be ready for a line that stretches to the outside. But thats ok, great things require time. When you make it inside they hand you a menu and ask if you would like anything to drink while you wait in line. They have quite the selection of meats. Since it was my first time i went for the Pheasant, Rabbit and Rattlesnake, and the Louisiana Hot Link. They were all great! Every meat different in their own way but delicious regardless. Complemented with some fries and a beer it was simply fantastic. I have one problem with this place though, it seems no one knows how to really pour a beer into a glass. What I mean is that when I would receive my beer, a little less than half of my beer was foam. I understand a layer of foam but when almost half of the glass is foam, you simply do not know how to serve a beer. It wasn't the first time and not the same bartender too. I tried a variety of beers because they have a great selection that I wanted to try. The same problem over and over and over again. I even overheard a guy telling his friends, \"I paid 8 dollars for a half full glass? what the hell is mickey mouse s***!\" So that is my only real grievance with this place. Maybe they were told to serve the beer this way? Who knows. Regardless, Great place for sausage, fries, and half full beer glasses."

Thank you baby Jesus in a manger for their truffle fries! You don't even need dipping sauces when your order their fries with truffle oil.I'm a vegetarian, so I'm limited to three options on their sausage menu, which is fine, I'm never disappointed. Hey, three options is a lot better than most places! My favorite is the Mexican chipotle,which actually isn't spicy at all (at least not to me). Also, all my meat eating friends who go with me have nothing but good things to say about their sausage selections. I really think the big selling point for Wurstküche is their ambiance. Because can you get great tasting food, cooked the right way, and a large German/ European beer selection at other locations? Yes. Of course, especially in LA. But as an Army brat, who was born in Munich, Germany, this place feeds my nostalgia as well as my stomach. Their open dining room with large bench seating reminds me of the annual Oktoberfest and it's always fun eating here, whether it be a quick bite before a Dodger game or an extended stay with lots of friends and lots of rounds of Spaten and Bitburger. Definitely give this place a try. Yes, its' a bit of a hipster joint, yes, it's a little overpriced, yes, it's trendy. But it's fun. The food is decent, the beer is on point and you get to share a good experience with whoever you decided to take with you."

The exotic meat is definitely eye catching, and where else will you try rattlesnake, rabbit, or veal. The truffle fries could use a bit more truffle, so ask for extra. I'm also into more thinner fries. Sauces! Love how you have so much to try out to figure out the perfect combo.suggestionsDont be afraid to try the rattlesnake & rabbit. If I can do it, you can!

According to one of the co-owner, Tyler Wilson,  Wurstküche is pronounced very similar to \"Voos-kee-ka\" meaning sausage kitchen. You will probably get a different pronunciation if you ask the Internet. Most likely, a fluent German speaking person will tell you that the word doesn't exist. So who knows.All I have to say is this place is expensive if you want to get drunk. If you're just looking to eat a hot dog and small fries with a beer, you will survive having to spend about $20. Good thing is that portions are fulfilling. People tend to be satisfied with the length and girth of the würst, and most people aren't greedy and become satisfy with just one. Sometimes some people feel brave and claim \"l've done this before, I know I can handle more than two würste\". Anyways, the  small order of fries are the equivalent of approximately one large potato. When it comes to the parking situation I have some good news, and unfortunately some bad new. The good news is that down Traction Avenue there's plenty of free parking spots with a 4 hour limit. The bad news is that you have be lucky or simply patient to get a spot. Your other option is to pay a few dollars at the parking lot, or there's some meters down 3rd street. Then, you may get traumatized when you see a 20 person line forming outside of the building, but it's not as bad as it seems. When you walk into the place, you immediately encounter the cooler with all the sausages, the kitchen, the beer spouts, and the cash register. The hallway to the right will lead you to the restrooms on your left side, and down the hall you have the dining room and the bar. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that if there's 20 people outside, then there's about 5 more people inside waiting in line; therefore, there's a fast moving line composed of 25 people. You will not have to confront a 25 person line, and most likely be lucky finding a parking spot if you know the correct time to visit. During the weekdays avoid the lunch rush hour between 11:30 to 2, and avoid the weekends. Wurstküche is located in the Arts District, so that means this area is Mecca for hipsters. If you're like Anthony Bourdain where hipster make him feel a type way, then all I have to say is to not panic. The only thing that you'll see are hipsters, non hipsters, old , and young drinking fancy beers (except the children) and taking bites off their würste ."

Eat here.+ the sausages (selection) + the fries+ the dipping sauces + the Order Ahead App+ the staff's knowledge of all the food/beer+ the kickback environment + the people watching - the wait, should def have more than 1 cash registerGreat late night eat. Chill date spot (with someone you know pretty well, I mean you are eating sausages and beer).OMG the sausage selection is stellar, from non pork, to their vegetarian options. I first went here with my EX who's a plant eater & she was able to eat & get full as well, whichwas cool when you're worried about ppls dietary restrictions.It's just so good. Mango habanero is my favorite & their walnut bacon dipping sauce for fries!!! My God on today"

You can add caramelized onions, spicy bell peppers, sweet bell peppers as a topping. The sausage also comes with fries that are amazing! You can also order some dipping sauces for the fries for .75 cents. I don't want to pay, but they're so good. I love getting the chipotle aioli and, sundried tomato mayo, and chipotle ketchup.

We ordered the rattlesnake & rabbit with sauerkraut, duck & bacon with sweet peppers and the Louisiana with caramelized onions and some fries with white truffle oil. The place was busy but we found a seat inside. They also have outside seating but it was a little cold. Our food was out fairly quickly about 15 minutes then it was time to enjoy. All dogs were good, flavor was great but the rattlesnake & rabbit was the best. My fiancée and I agreed that the dogs needed like some mayo or mustard on it but then again the sauces were on the table so we could have added it our selfs. We will definitely be back when we are around the area. Who doesn't like weird, crazy and delicious food."

However, it didn't really cause a war in my tummy - it caused sheer delight! The sausage was amazingly great and so were the Belgian fries. I washed it all down with water. Thank you to the fabulous Phillip N. for treating me =) They have classic, gourmet and exotic sausages.Usually there is a long line to get in here but we came here at the right time and avoided it.The dining area is like a mess hall so get used to sitting next to strangers. The food is so good you just won't care - even if you are the greatest misanthrope. I know beer and sausages go together, and they have a great variety of beers here, but still I didn't have any.The Arts District was relatively unknown until recently. Places like Wurstkuche and The Pie Hole have changed that and the new megagigantic apartment complex called One Santa Fe nearby is going to make things even worse. Parking wasn't so difficult a while back but now it is sheer hell. Get ready to drive around and around till someone leaves. There is a lot nearby but you have to pay there.I love this place because I get to practice my German LOL - which I studied at UCSB. The word Wurstkuche means \"sausage kitchen\". I love to hear people try to pronounce it - especially my BF haha. It should be pronounced vuwst-kuu-he. Wurst should be pronounced like you have a potato in your mouth.The ch should sound like it does in the name Corey CHaim LOL. Some people pronounce it with an sh sound but it drives me up the wall even though parts of Germany do indeed pronounce it that way."

I only like freshly baked bread from actual restaurants. This one just feels diluted in some way, airy, foamed up. The sausages were just like whatever too. Maybe the ratios were off. You ask for 2 toppings and they throw them on there for you. The sausages are not big. An LA street hotdog is like 5 times better than any of the hotdogs I tried here. If you get a street hotdog you get the bacon, mayo, grilled onions, a grilled jalapeno and regular bread (It's not freshly baked but it doesn't feel like a damn sponge). A street hotdog is like 5 bucks on a busy night, this place sells the hotdogs for 7 bucks and up.  I wouldn't recommend this place unless you want to eat a hotdog and drink a beer at the same time. Also, when I went, they had a DJ. They have outside seating.  Another thing, their fries. They sucked. I'm not big on salt but these fries tasted like they had none. You get a dipping of choice with your fries. I picked chipotle ketchup but I couldn't taste any of the chipotle.  I had high expectations of this place because the times I've passed through there they always have a long line. Why do people like this place? I don't know. Maybe they've never had a LA street hot dog. Even a costco hotdog is better than one from here, at least price wise.  Attire: Wear a stupid bowtie and suspenders."

Finally after months of searching I have found my SoCal Top Dog. I ordered the hot link and it was exactly how a hot link should be... HOT! I've been to Pink's and tried their hot link and to my surprise it was not good, decent at best. This place is the real dog. They have every type of hot dog. If you're in the area and want a great, delicious hot dog is say come to this place. The only downside, but I'm ok with it, is the price. TopDog prices their dogs at $3 and I usually get two. Here one dog with toppings adds to about $8-$10 dollars which isn't bad! Definitely one of the best places I have been to in LA! The vibe is super laid back and don't forget to order beer. They have some killer selection. Also, a rare thing to see was three solid options for vegetarians. My two vegetarian friends feasted on their dogs and said they were the best they had ever had. Vegetarians know how hard it is to find a veggie dog. Check this place out people!"

Vegetarian options are available however that's never gonna happen for me!  An assortment of mustards are on each table.Food was outstanding - two toppings are included, I went with the sweet peppers and the hot peppers. (other choices are caramelized onions and sauerkraut) I was lucky to enjoy this place with some fellow Yelpers, we ordered a few different sausages each - then cut them up and shared - a great way to try several items! I checked their prices against my local place for brats (Mattern Meats) - prices are comparable for the Classic wursts - prices climb for the Gourmet and Exotics portion of the menu - but that's to be expected, and was not a problem for me! Enjoyed everything I tried: Classic Bratwurst was very good; Austin Blues -hot and spicy, tri-pepper & hardwood smoked pork from the Gourmet Menu; and from the Exotics menu - Duck & Bacon With Jalapeño Peppers; Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned With White Wine; and Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapeño Peppers. The last one had me wondering - could you feed jalapeños to a  rabbit, feed the rabbit to a rattlesnake then kill it to make the sausage? These are they types of thoughts you have when hanging out with Roy B.Shared some fries - the dipping sauces are the star of the show - especially the Bleu Cheese Walnut And Bacon - a table favorite.Best value in the place - a pint of PBR for $3 - That was my choice - and I was high fived by several at the bar for making it! I think Roy was a little bummed when he got his wine glass size, half foam 8 dollar whatever it was.Community tables and benches make for a friendly place, I would have liked the option to get a pitcher of beer - but I hear the place gets very crowded later in the evening and it seems like a good place to hang out - so pitchers not be a good idea.Would be a regular if they opened one of these in North OC!!"

They were raving about this place so I'm glad I got to try it! I got the duck and rabbit sausage, fries, and the black cherry soda. Everything was amazeballs!!!! I'm a french fries kind of girl and their fries did not disappoint! Goes well with the chipotle aoli sauce. I didn't like the chipotle ketchup sauce. I was actually contemplating between the duck and rabbit or rattlesnake and rabbit sausage before decided on duck. I was too chicken to eat rattlesnake. Too chicken to eat the whole thing but I still wanted to try it so I took a bite out of my friend's rattlesnake and rabbit sausage. LOL it was firm. There was a crunch when you bite into the sausage. Now I can say I ate snakes once. They offer a good variety of beer and sodas. If you don't find anything you want to drink then you my friend, are high maintenance. The crowds was a mix. We came during the day so there were families, couples, singles, and large groups. Maybe they're different at night. Line will be long but it goes by fast."

After ordering, if you go down the hallway, it leads to a nice, roomy (hidden) beer hall.  Brick walls, industrial, and old school, with a bar and bartender.  Nice atmosphere.For the food, I had the Bratwurst with sauerkraut and Sun-dried tomatoes with Mozzarella,  Curiosity Cola, and Belgium Fries.  Both were quite flavorful with a pleasant kick.  The bratwurst was nice and meaty and  Sun-dried tomatoes with Mozzarella has a nice, slightly sweeter flavor. There are various choices of mustard on each table--the Dijon has the biggest kick.   Excellent Belgium fries...nicely seasoned and crispy.  Located within the art district, there is street parking.  Remember to watch your meters as my parking ticket (yesterday) was $63.00 as of this writing.  A group of 2-4 should fit fine.  Sausages are tasty, somewhat pricey, but they're meaty and the old style beer hall definitely kicks it up a notch."

Wurstkuche's fries were so fresh with a crispy outer layer and fluffy potato center. I'd say they are very similar to Slater's fries but better because they were garlicky! Get the fries as a side to whatever sausage you are ordering. You won't regret it. And get chipotle aioli as your dipping sauce. As for the sausages, I tried one of the classics vegetarian smoked apple sage and two of the exotics crocodile and rattlesnake and rabbit. I like how all the sausages are not ordinary in any way. You can't really go wrong on your first visit just randomly picking one off the menu. Of the three, I'd like to try the rattlesnake and rabbit again. I am not too sure if I like it or not. The sausage was moist and juicy. The taste of it though was hard to describe. My taste buds have never tried rattlesnake and rabbit before I guess. I didn't like the crocodile sausage too much because of the thick casing. It was a bit too chewy and dry. Overall, Wurstküche is definitely a nice spot in dtla to hang out with friends with good food and drinks! I can't wait to be back to have more Belgian fries goodness."

I am all about \"the best fries\" so I was down.It's like a ride at an amusement park. There's a long anticipatory wait outside (probably 15 minutes) that is on the verge of being annoying, but the anticipation holds you over until you get in the front door. Once you get in, you are greeted by a server who asks if you want beer. ALWAYS SAY YES (unless you are underage). That beer will make your wait in line the greatest wait in line you will ever have.You'll get hungrier. You will inch closer as you snake around a small, brightly lit room, drinking Weinstephaner Vitus, talking with your friends about how the Vitus is one of the best beers you've ever tasted, and getting excited as you see the raw sausages on display. You may change your mind a few times.You'll order, and you will most certainly order fries WITH the truffle oil. It is mandatory in my opinion.You'll then carry your number and your beer down a long hallway and you will hear a faint, ever growing bass line from what seems to be house music. You turn a corner and you see something you would not expect. It's a huge room with long tables, ANOTHER bar and mustard/ketchup bottles everywhere. There is also a hipster looking DJ.You will then order another beer at the bar, and talk with your friends about how random and crazy this place is and you will be starving. The food will come out and you will eat it and say how bomb it is considering you are slightly buzzed.You will then go back to the bar and order an apple pie ice cream sandwich. You'll ask to quarter it so that you can share it easily with your party.You'll then exit through the large door into the cool night and get ready for the rest of your night, probably in J town."

For some reason, Wurstcüche thought it would be apropos to have a DJ rockin' away on Father's Day, because what better way to celebrate the dad in your life than with loud pop/indie music and a sausage.Like I mentioned, Yelper Ben Y. and I went to Wurstcüche with his father and grandfather to celebrate Dad's Day. We arrived around 2pm that Sunday and the place was hoppin'. It was packed to the brim and the music was cranked. We could barely hear each other as we waited for our orders, and basically had to repeat everything we said, despite how loud we yelled. The food was good. It wasn't spectacular. I ordered kielbasa with fries. The fries were good, and the kielbasa was pretty good too. Like I said, nothing outstanding. As for the menu, I'll give them an extra star. If you're in the mood for something really strange and exotic, Wurstcüche is your place. There's stuff on the menu that I wouldn't dare try. Same with the beer selection. They've got a huge array of beer, it's nearly overwhelming.I don't know if I'd go back to Wurstcüche based on the overly loud and borderline-generic food experience I had. But I tried it!"

I basically used that aioli sauce for my hotdog and fries & demolished however much they gave us. For vegetarians: I tried the Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle with grilled onion and saurkraut. I didn't get a lot of grilled onions, so that kind of sucked. Other than that, the hot dog was really good and spicy! I added BBQ sauce and the orange aioli sauce they provided us with and enjoyed every bite of it! The front cashier told me that these hot dogs are also vegan but the buns are not, so if you're vegan beware. I also tried my friend's Vegetarian Smoked Apple hot dog, and I don't think I liked this one as much. It was rather bland and if it were mine, i would've had to lather it with even more sauces than necessarily. Street parking wasn't too hard to find on a Tuesday night, but I'm assuming it gets a lot worse during the weekends. I'm also assuming it gets a lot more crowded during the weekends as well. It's rather affordable at about $6-7 per hot dog. The seating can be limited if it gets busy. The seats are set up as lunch tables and it's rather dimly lit with a very hipster feel. I've also been to the Culver City location, and I think that location is a little bigger than the DTLA one."

However, they ran out of the it so I settled for the Italian vegetarian sausage with the Belgian fries. The Italian tasted a bit funky and off to me, but it's probably because it was vegetarian. I did expect something more from this purveyor of sausages though.Since I prefer fries of the shoestring, skinny variety, the Belgian fries were also a miss for me): They are cut into thick slices, and the condiments were eh too.

Other times I've been here during the evenings and the lines were out the door, but not this time it was a nice change for once. I tend to be a creature of habit and always order the same thing. I got the mango jalepeño which is a turkey and chicken sausage. With any dog you order you get to choose two toppings. I ordered the caramelized onions and the sweet peppers. There are a total of 4 toppings you can choose. the other two ate spicy peppers or sauerkraut. My toppings added a nice crunch. The peppers had grilled marks. That was so delicious. Like that smokiness taste. I love my veggies grilled. 5/5I also tried the filipino Maharlika, which is a sweet pork sausage. Totally tasted like longuinesa (which is a filipino sausage). This was very juicy. 4/5The other sausage I tried was the rabbit veal and pork seasoned with white wine sauce. This was amaze balls. Definitely a must try, but my fave will always be the mango jalepeño one. The flavors are just so outstanding in this one. 5/5I also ordered the Klein fries, which are like steak fries . The cut is very thick. Seasoned very well and was crunchy and hot. fries are very well made. love me my potatoes!!! With the fries you get to choose one dipping sauce. I chose the curry ketchup which had a nice spice and kick to it. The are a bunch of other dipping sauces such as chipotle aoli, buttermilk ranch, chipotle ketchup, pesto mayo, sweet & sassy bbq, Thai peanut, blue cheese walnut & bacon, sundried tomato mayo, and the tzatziki sauce. Any Additional dipping sauces are 0.75 cents extra. 5/5For my beverages I got Mr. Q cucumber drink. If you guys have never tried this its so refreshing and light. It's like a carbonated drink with a hint if cucumber. Not too sweet at all. I love it. 5/5And got a shantelle beer(sorry totally forgot the name). Very similar to a hefeweizen. This bebr was pretty darn good. Went great with the sausages. 5/5So once you order your meal at the front and pay for it they hand you a number. Grab a seat inside or if you prefer outside seating they have that as well. And the come and bring your order to you. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. Always a wonderful experience here with delicious food and great ambiance. Nice change to come for once when it's not so packed and crowded."

There's no minimum for ordering to-go, but once you order greater than 12 sausages, they'll put a cap on the variety you can order (no more than 3 types for that order). Once you place your order, they'll give you an estimated time of when your order will be ready. Mine was 15-20 minutes (surprised? I sure was). Go to the back bar when you arrive, pick up your order, pay for it, and off you go! Relatively painless process, even though it was barely past peak lunch hours.Many thanks to the staff at Wurstkuche for the awesome service! Will definitely be back! :)Note:* The darjeeling tea is sold by the bottle (hence the heft $4.50 price tag).

Arts District and decided to start exploring starting with Wurstküche.  Our maiden voyage went well with us standing in line to get in to order. Once we were in the property line a sweet lady asked us if we would like a beer to start off.  I didn't know what I wanted and after a few probing questions she handed me a Duchess en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du… .  This was now MY beer.  Hubby ordered a Belgium beer as well and was pleased.  This was all about me as I am not normally a beer drinker but this Lambic style beer was Heaven in a glass! When it came time for us to order, we decided on Pheasant with Herbs de Provence and Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers.  You can pick two toppings:Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers, and Spicy Peppers. Gourmet mustards - self serve in the back Whole Grain Dijon, Spicy Brown, Honey Mustard, American Yellow and KetchupWe took our beers to the dining area and was greeted with wood beam ceiling, brick walls, european type seating, some round tables with a benches and a few semi private tables in a room that can be closed off. Both were juicy and delicious.  With the Spicy Brown mustard we slathered on the sausage it was hard to tell what we were consuming.  The fries are extremely good with a nice crunch.  We have been back 5 or 6 times now and when we have Hoshi we sit out on the patio and simply enjoy the DTLA view and relax. Parking can be a bear.  Limited and expensive in the evening.   Here's a little secret, if you just want to come in and order beers, you don't have to wait in line at the front entrance, you can come through the side entrance, order your beers and sit at the bar or any available seating.  Sausages - 5 StarsSelection of beers - 5 StarsBartender - 5 Stars - knowledgeable and asks probing questions to meet your beer needs. Fries - 5 Stars Decor - 5 Stars - great marriage of concrete, brick and wood.  If this place is indicative of the feel of The Arts District, I look forward to exploring some more!"

All the sausages are unique so I suggest going easier on the condiments to fully embrace the flavor. I highly recommend the hot Italian sausage for that extra level of spiciness. It can also get really crowded on weekend evenings so plan ahead! I visit once ever few months and the beer selection is always the same. Luckily they have a pretty diverse selection of craft beers on tap. If you don't know what pairs well with the particular sausage you are ordering, feel free to ask! They'll be more than happy to help you.Tip: there's free street parking a few blocks south, however it will require a bit of walking"

I don't know if it's really that German-style but there is a huge selection of sausages that range from \"normal\" to eclectic choices, as well as veggie and vegan choices for some of you. The meat is very, very succulent. Also, you can get an assortment of toppings (sauerkraut, yay!) and ridiculously good sauces if you get fries. Go for the truffle fries - yum! My favorite was the creamy bacon dip (bleu cheese walnut and bacon). The atmosphere is definitely hip - it's wedged into the Art District of DTLA so go figure. I like that the ordering sections separated from the dining area, which is in the back after a very cool and dark hallway. Parking can be a hassle if it's a busy day, but generally you can find street parking. It's DTLA after all. The only con of this place is that sometimes the line wraps outside of the down and down the block."

Didn't get any of the dogs to try so we snuck in through the back door that leads straight to the bar and seating area. Wanted to start out with something a little lighter before hitting anything hard we tried a few off the menu.A strawberry beer which tasted like a cooler or fresher drink and the chimay white which was similar to a blue moon or long board with it's hidden 8% content!With my love for beer I had two rounds of chimay white which I was able to feel after standing up! Don't let the taste trick you. The staff was good. The female a little fierce but def fits her and works for her. While in art district, this is a must to visit!"

I have never heard any complaints about the food here, everything seems to be \"organic\" and made from scratch. I can also say that all of their sauces are home made and taste absolutely divine. Great place for group settings, ambiance is warm and relaxing...even if you do not know the people around you, they kinda feel like family. I noticed they even have a DJ booth in the restaurants, I know you can have private parties and such but I have never been to one there myself...I can see how it would be fun though! Def a MUST visit kind of place if you come to LA!!! They even sell Sausage that you can take home and cook yourself.*They do have Vegan hot dog options, but they do not stick to strict vegan specifics."

This was when all the club kids were pre-gaming and filling up at this Arts District institution.To talk about the food...The Rattlesnake and Sun-Dried Tomato dogs was what I order for my friend and I. It took forever for it to come out but it tasted amazing. It was slightly burnt but it definitely brought out the taste of the specially made meats. The onions, sauerkraut, and peppers added color to the dog. Their beer selections are pretty big.The layout of this place is so cool. First you line up and place your order with the smiling hostess who takes her time to introduce you to their sausage varieties with exotic names. After that you are ushered down this long, dark, club-like alleyway to the dining area where you feel like you just entered a happening club. There was an edm dj that friday night, so yeah...felt like a club that only served delicious German sausages and beer. So with the loud edm and rowdy club kids, don't expect to get any conversation done unless you have a booming voice."

The fries, when they aren't overcooked/burned, are good.  The spot is in a cool corner of the Arts District, just east of downtown/Little Tokyo. The djs seem to be getting better at maintaining a nice vibe thru the evening. If you arrive after sundown, you will be in line for a bit, just to order food.  The crowd is a nice mixed crowd of guys and gals. The drinks, well, there is a weird rule about giving you too much beer head, that is frothy foam. I don't feel they do this for presentation, and I agree, a beer/ale should have its respective amount of frothy foam, but not to the point that it looks as if the bartender drank some of my drink.  It's just hilarious to see their adherence to this maneuver.  Wide selection is a plus."

The wait was actually kinda long to order but once we ordered it wasn't hard to find seating at 2pm on a Saturday.  They have long tables and then some smaller ones near the walls.FOOD: You pick what toppings you want (2 of the 4) sweet peppers, spicy peppers, carmelized onions and...maybe one more which I can't remember.Then, you can choose which kind of hot dog you want.  My boyfriend got the rattlesnake and rabbit one and I got to crocodile and pork one.  To be honest, I would say that next time I come I'll get a normal hot dog, the two \"exotic\" ones weren't my cup of tea.  Not because they tasted weird or because of the strange ingredients but because they didn't have that hot dog consistency or taste.  I can't explain it but the texture of the rattlesnake one was kinda strange and then mine was too tough and dry.  I liked the peppers though and they have 4 different types of mustard you can get.The bun was very fresh and slightly toasted, which was nice.We got the belgian fries with the truffle oil and two dipping sauces (tzatziki sauce and the pesto mayo) both very good and refreshing, that truffle oil, even though you have to pay extra for it made it taste extra good.I'm not sure if I'm a complete fan of the belgian fries because they are thicker cut but very fresh and very good.ATMOSPHERE: LOVED it, very trendy, clean, modern, with angled tables and serving dishes, number holders etc.  It has a bar and I heard at night they have a DJ so very lively.  A fun, airy, place to go with friends or family.Definitely worth checking out, if you just want to say you tried the exotic meats say it but if you don't care, I say got with a normal dog."

There is a young, hipster, chill vibe to the place. We seemed so lost because we didn't know where to order nor where to sit. It's a communal-style seating arrangement with long benches. Don't be scrubs like us, and ask random people where to order. The main entrance is right across The Pie Hole, and you order there (there'll be a glass case full of wieners). After ordering, go to the back and seat yourselves. I've tried the Crocodile & Pork Andouille, Lamb w/ Mediterranean Spices, and Rattlesnake & Rabbit w/ Jalapeno Peppers. I always top it with Caramelized Onions and Spicy Peppers. Croc & Pork: the sausage was pretty tough and chewy. The flavor was really good, but the texture was off-putting. Lamb w/ Mediterranean Spices: it was really juicy and packed w/ flavor. I liked this more than the croc sausage. Rattlesnake & Rabbit: this was my favorite one! The sausage was lean and tender. Be adventurous and eat a snake!Overall, this spot has various exotic and \"normal\" sausages that is worth giving a try. Adding one (or a combo) of the four mustards they have on top makes the sausage better. Also, pair it w/ one of their Belgian/German beers. I would come back and try something else, but at a random time to avoid the line."

This is the perfect place to go if you're visiting town, hosting friends, or if you and a big group of friends want to go somewhere to relax. It can get especially packed during dinner time, and I've seen a long line out of the door several times starting at 10 or 11 pm. But with the way it's set up with lining up to order and then finding a table, the flow usually works so that you can find a table. I typically don't have any issue getting a table with friends and I've gone at busy and slow times.Now... as for the food! YUM!!!!!! All of the exotic 'brats are great! I've tried a few of them but I'm pretty settled on the 'Rattlesnack & Rabbit' because it has just the right amount of spice for me! A close second is the 'Mango Jalapeno' again because of a perfect amount of spice, but also with the mango twist. I HIGHLY encourage you to get a side of truffle fries to go with whichever 'brat you pick! PLEASE DO! Even if you're not that hungry, split it with a friend or two. The fries are some of the best I've ever had! I'm a chipotle lover so I also accompany the fries with Chipotle Aioli or Chipotle Ketchup (or both).I usually don't go for the beers because my favorite place to drink (Angel City Brewery) is right down the street. That said I've had a few of their beers and I'd recommend the Chimay White."

I also experimented with majority of the mustards available and the dijon mustard and whole grain went well with my Rattlesnake and Rabbit while my wifes Chicken Apple was tasty on it own. This place will definitely be one of my \"go to\" spots when I come visit So. Cal again. So if you guys are in the area, check it out!!Happy eats!!!"

We ordered the rattlesnake sausage with a side of large fries with the pesto mayo and chipotle aioli, both of which were delicious (the pesto mayo is better). My friend got a strawberry flavored drink, not sure what it was exactly but it was good! We were seated promptly after ordering. Its quite popular with a younger crowd, which i enjoyed. The seating is picnic style, which I found to be cute. Overall I dug the atmosphere and the food/drinks are good. I definitely plan on coming back!"

I love me some good snake.So far I've been here twice and I've been very happy. The first time I may have been a bit overzealous and gotten two sausages... big mistake. The flavors soon started melding together and it wasn't so satisfying. Enter my second visit, I decided to keep it simple and go with one. I enjoyed this so much more. I also had the truffle fries, which were decent. My favorite part of the meal was the Duchesse beer. Man, they've got some good beer.If you're on the fence about this place, I'd say give it a try. You never know, duck and bacon may just be your thing."

Once we got to the line though, I saw that it was just a case of one-register. Still, for just serving sausages and frites, it was pretty good business. I got the rattlesnake while my friend got the gator, gluten free style (ie no bun). We got an order of frites to share, with curry ketchup and that blue cheese/walnut dipping sauce. We washed them down with some sarsaparilla. Surprisingly to my tastebuds, there was little to no aftertaste.  The rattlesnake had a nice amount of heat to it from the jalapenos, and the addition of rabbit gave it a nice balance.We ate up at the front in the cash register area as the music in the main area was too loud for us (it was almost midnight) to have a conversation."

Two of us shared two hotdogs: (1) a mango jalapeño dog with caramelized onions and sweet peppers, and (2) a sun-dried tomato and mozzarella dog with sauerkraut and sweet peppers.  Both had a chicken and turkey base, and both were easily the most delicious hotdogs I've ever come across.  We also shared a large (\"groot\") side of Belgian-style hand-cut fries, which were cooked to a perfect crisp.  Even better were the dipping sauces -- we had the tzatziki as well as the bleu cheese walnut and bacon.  (If you've never tried dipping your fries in tzatziki -- do it!  You can thank me later.)  There's also abundant bottles of free mustards and ketchup on all the tables.  Wurstküche is hotdog heaven.  Trust me -- one bite and you'll be smitten, just like I was."

Line was a little slow, but I definitely didn't help that myself so I cannot complain (just noting it!). Seating was plentiful and our food came pretty quickly. I ordered a brat with sweet peppers and a large fry with chipotle aioli. The fries are Belgian style, and were delicious though some were a bit too crisp or burnt. The brat was cooked just right and delicious. The bun it was sitting in was one of the best rolls I've ever had in a restaurant, period (bun may have overshadowed the brat, to be honest). I had a cream soda with my meal and I think it worked well with the everything I ate, but I wish they were slightly cheaper :( The selection is awesome and I'm very much looking forward to returning to try more sausages :) I think I will get something with buffalo, next time.Another note on food/drink selection: I don't drink, but the people I ate with enjoyed the German beers they ordered...take that as you will. I only wish it was slightly cheaper because I definitely should've gotten two or three sausages, but I didn't want to ruin my tiny budget for eating out ($6 for basic sausages to $8 for the fancier ones) :( Looking forward to a return trip the next time the guys are in town!"

A little high for my taste.When we went to go sit down, it's a little awkward when it's crowded and you squeeze your way onto the bench at the communal table. For a little while, we were standing, just trying to figure out where to sit.Overall, the food was decent and it's great to go with a group of friends.

Some kind stranger decided to help us out and point us into the back corner that leads into another area for food. When we did discover the food, it was nothing short of glorious. For $6 to $8 you get a sausage on bun with two toppings. Fries come in small and large, you get one or two dipping sauces depending on size. That's it. Simple and straight forward.We got the Mango Jalapeno and Duck Bacon to share, fries with curry ketchup and chipotle aoili dipping sauces. Each of the sausages have their own distinct texture and flavor. The mango jalapeno wasn't too spicy but had a kick, really juicy. The duck bacon wasn't so juicy, and was on the dry side. I think the real distinction is the dipping sauce for the fries. Delicious! I put that sh*t on everything! Even my sausage dogs! The fries on it's own are pretty blah but it made for a good sauce scooper. There's a good selection of unique sodas here too, like cucumber and elderflower.

The food here was DELICIOUS.Being a vegetarian for majority of my life, I have to admit that I was pretty apprehensive and hesitant about trying this place when my boyfriend recommended it. I mean, it's a sausage restaurant. What could I possibly order and actually enjoy that's vegetarian friendly at a restaurant that primarily sells sausages?Upon our arrival, an employee approached us and handed us coupons for free Klein fries with one dipping sauce since they had ran out of buns. Well, that seemed strange, but we still wanted to have dinner here so we accepted the coupons and ordered our meal. I had the Vegetarian Italian with caramelized onions and spicy peppers, and fries with the Chipotle Aioli, while my boyfriend opted for the Bratwurst with caramelized onions and spicy peppers with fries and the Sweet and Sassy BBQ dipping sauce.Although bun-less, we thoroughly enjoyed our sausages. Did I mention this was the first time I had ever tried a sausage type dish? I was surprised at how much flavor it had, although the fennel was a bit overwhelming over the other ingredients. Everything tastes really great and cooked perfectly. The fries were probably the best fries Ive ever tasted. Crispy, hot, and salted just slightly enough to get a hint of the flavor. The dipping sauces were also really fun along with the assortment of mustards to choose from. I loved the indoor dining area and noted how well the space was designed and had a very sophisticated and upscale atmosphere for a fast-food type restaurant.Wurstküche is truly a gem in the Downtown Los Angeles area. I highly recommend this place if you're a vegetarian, or not a vegetarian! Theres something for everyone."

Their sausages are super delish as well.Popped in on a Friday night to pick up some grub for the Hollywood Bowl.

Woot! Blanche de Bruxelles I love u!!!They had one of my fav beers on draft and it's super rare that I find it. I've never had it in California. First time I had that beer was in Hawaii at a yard house n second time was in Denver at a bar that specialized in Belgium brews. I am a beer nerd.I was in Brussels and asked about this particular beer at the local microbrewery specializing pub and they weren't huge fans because to them it's not a microbrew and the company isn't actually in Brussels it's located in a small town outside of Brussels and as locals they were offended by the semantics. But whatever!! As an American I love this Beer and Wurstkuche had it. If Wurstkuche could get their hands on some Cantillion Gueze I'd be in Heaven. (Hint. Hint.)Ok but I digress back to the review of Wurstkuche.The line was out the door but once you cross the business threshold and make it inside you were allowed to order beer and enjoy it while you wait. There was a friendly white guy in dreads managing the line, taking everyone's orders and shouting em back to the staff. I love that they were trying to keep us happy while we waited. The beers are all served in their appropriate glass. It was fun to see people holding oddly shaped glasses with different colored brews in line. It illustrated the diverse selection.The crowd was totally hipster and super friendly. It was so much fun to stand in line and socialize. It seemed like it was a lot of people's first time there. I could overhear lots of conversations saying so n so told me to order this. Yelp told me to order the rattlesnake and rabbit and that's what I ordered. I was a little scared to eat the rattlesnake sausage as we had just found and had to kill a rattlesnake in our yard a few days ago. I think I ordered it because I had to conquer my fear of snakes and taking a bite out of it would help me take a bite out of my fear. I just hope a rattlesnake doesn't return the favor and take a bite out of me one day!!! My friend ordered the duck and that was good too. I loved that the flavors were so distinctly different. The sausages and the buns and fixings held up well until we finally got them to the Hollywood Bowl were able to settle down and enjoy them. The large order of Belgium fries on the other hand and the chipotle aioli and the blue cheese walnut sauce didn't last long. We gobbled that up on our walk back to the car and on our drive over to the Hollywood Bowl. So Goood!!!"

I had the rattlesnake and rabbit and the pheasant, both were very delicious and cooked to perfection.The icing on the cake though, what makes me say I'm definitely coming back, is the service and the care the restaurant put in for their customers. As the food came \"late\" (not really that late at all, they were extremely busy, we understood and we were busy socializing anyway), they gave us a side of fries and an ice cream sandwich each, on the house, for being \"late\".Well done, Wuestkuche, you've earned yourself a new customer, and I'll definitely be recommending.

But, Wurstkuche, you took it to a whole new level, and I cannot wait to come back.It was an interesting concept and didn't know what to expect when I approached the entrance. Oh, just a little bit of a line out the door. I was able to look over the menu to get some ideas. Normally, bratwurst and kielbasa can satisfy me until one of the persons I went with (who has tried various sausages here), gave me a few suggestions. The suggestions, however, were 'exotic.' They had rabbit, alligator, and even rattlesnake. I haven't experienced any of those meats, but I was eager to give it a try. I decided on the Alligator & Pork, Smoked Andouille Sausage with caramelized onions and spicy peppers with a side of fries and their chipotle aioli sauce to pair with it. Also, got a Belgian beer to go with it. $20 bucks later and I'm headed to the seating area. It was nice. There was family style seating and smaller tables. There was plenty of natural lighting, which was beautiful, and each table came with its own condiments. There was a full bar which made ordering drinks hard to avoid. Food came out quick and I was happy with the size. The fries were great, exactly to my liking.  Lightly salted and some were crispy some weren't and I love that. My sausage? Smoky and really tasty. I can't even explain it in further detail, except I thoroughly enjoyed it. Buns? Could maybe use some work. I could understand it may take away from the sausage itself, but I thought I'd throw that in here.I would come here for food and beer. Shoot, I'd even come for the beer. I typically prefer pints at $6 or less so anything that doesn't match that, I pretty much don't come back to. But, I liked this place and the quality of the menu, both beer and food, to  come back again.Lastly, service is wonderful! The guys at the bar are super friendly! Thanks for great customer service, Anderson."

The sauerkraut was not that great at all and I scrapped it off. The sweet peppers and onions were good.  The fries are a waste of time.  They have no real taste and despite looking like they have seasoning they don't taste like it.  Overall I would come here only if a group of people really wanted to come but I would not do so by myself."

I've tried pretty much all the 'exotic' sausages, as well as the more tame ones (chicken, beef, pork, other boring meats) and I haven't met a Wurstkuche sausage I didn't like! The rattlesnake is spicy and has a complex, sort of smokey flavor. The alligator, both times I've had it, can get a little dry, but just smother it in some mustard. The fries here are especially good, super crispy and you get to pick your own sauce. You can't go wrong with bleu cheese. The staff here is also really helpful in pairing beer with food. They carry a ton of German & Belgian beers which you can order at the register and if that one isn't enough, they have a bar in the eating area. The eating area can get crowded, and the mustards tend to get distributed everywhere, but if you ask any of the staff there they're more than happy to hunt your desired mustard down. I've come here as a party of two, and with a group of up to 10 people and every time has been a cinch. Service is quick & efficient, and Pie Hole is right across the street"

The way it works is:1) Get in the consistently ridiculous line(~30min - 1.5 hrs later)2) order and pay at the front counter; obtain drinks/beer immediately3) Take your number and go to the back part of the restaurant, where there's a bar with beers on tap and many tables/long communal tables.4) wait 10-20min5) get food and eatIs the food worth the wait? Sometimes. Usually when I go, I get one of their classics ($6) (the brat is great!), and they're juicy and delicious. However, this time, I ordered the pheasant with herbs de provence (8$), and was sorely disappointed. The flavor of the sausage was ALL herbes - where was the pheasant? It was also very dry, which was very disappointing because the menu says that it's juicy! Sadness :(The fries are delicious, however; thick-cut, crunchy on the outside and pillowy on the inside, and piping hot, definitely a highlight. The truffled cheese topping is completely worth it.The bottled lemonade they have is ok; it tastes slightly under-lemony, however.Finally, their toppings: while they're good, I wish they had more variety so that I could customize my order more. Their selection of mustards is great, but the honey mustard (usually my favorite) tasted a bit off this time around.Verdict: Good for a casual stop-in if you have a lot of time to stand in line. Beer selection is great, and their classics + fries are worth it."

Great variety of sausages from exotic meats to more run-of-the-mill to accommodate most tastes. I strongly recommending trying two, preferably ones from the exotic section but if that's not your thing, any of the others are great too but it's all about trying different options. Sauces are great and they have a nice variety as well. If you opt for fries, be sure to get the truffle oil. It's a must have.What goes best with sausages? Beer. Before many of the gastropubs had many craft beers on tap, Wurstkuche was there. Imports and local craft beer alike, they have a nice selection."

A wall full of 2 seater tables and 2 long benches for all to share.If you have personal space issues don't come here. This is the place to mingle with fellow LA peeps and foodies. & get ready to get messy! Im not a veggie but I Love their tomato, mozzarella & basil sausage! I tried the farro veggie sausage... Definitely didn't fancy it at all. Their duck & bacon one is Delish too! Oh & their fries are mouth watering and become even better when you get the bleu cheese & bacon .... And.... The ketchup curry dipping sauces! Yes yes yes.... Everything about this place is good. The ambience, food, drinks, booze, friendliness of employees & location. You'd be crazy not to come here! :)"

Its menu is definitely a novelty, but maybe it's just me.. they taste like regular sausages. I had the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage as it was the most exotic one available, but it wasn't anything special. The fries were good but also nothing special.Their selection of beer is pretty good. Unfortunately for me, I never really remember what I like and what I've tried, so I decided to go for something I've never tried: strawberry flavored beer. It was pretty much like soda.. or hard cider.. you get what I mean. I don't think they mention how big the beers are cuz my strawberry juice/beer was really small compared to my friend's Blue Moon :[ We went on a Sunday for lunch, and it was pretty poppin. We managed to find a seat in this little table wedged into the corner. I think it could be a cool bar (maybe it's like that at night..)I liked the location though.. It was kinda east of Little Tokyo. Lots of street art/ graffiti and a handful of geocaches around. However, since I live in the valley, coming out to east LA is pretty far (I know there's another location in Venice), but even if it were closer to me, I don't know if I'd necessarily come back."

USA! USA!I haven't found a place like this in San Diego so I always look forward to coming here when I'm in LA. I'm not too adventurous to try their more exotic items (still working on it) but I am a fan of their Sun Dried Tomato and Mozzarella and Mango Jalapeno sausages. And always gotta get that order of Belgian Fries (the Thai Peanut sauce is my favorite!). The drinks they serve are also good AND you can even order them as you wait in line to order your food. Yes! :D"

        "review": "Came here on a Sunday for an early dinner and it was pretty busy.  It took maybe at least 15 minutes of circling around the vicinity of Wurstkuche looking for street parking before I gave in and paid $5 to park in a lot.  We waited about 15min in line to order split 3 sausages and the groot belgian fries between two people.  1.  Kielbasa- polish style pork & beef, onions & spices with Sauerkraut and Hot Peppers.  The Kielbasa was AMAZING! Very flavorful.2.  Sun Dried Tomato & Mozarella - Smoked Chicken and Turkey with Carmelized Onions and Sweet Peppers.  Delicious! Not too heavy and still juicy and well balanced. 3.  Austin Blues -Hot and Spicy, tri-pepper & hardwood smoked pork with Sauerkraut and Carmelized Onions.  Wasn't my favorite, was a bit bland in comparison to the Kielbasa and Sun Dried Tomato & Mozarella--but still pretty good.   For our belgian fries we had the choice of two dipping sauces.  We ended up getting the Bleu Cheese Walnut & Bacon and the Curry Ketchup.  I was dissappointed in the Bleu Cheese Walnut sauce...it didn't have much taste or flavor to it.  The Curry Ketchup on the other hand had a blast of flavor.  It was good, but I'm definitely curious as to what the other sauces taste like.  I think it'd be cool if Wurstkuche just had all the sauces available to everyone, I think that would be an aspect that they should incorporate, especially if they wanted their patrons to fully enjoy their meal.  Just like how Chick-fil-a has all those sauces available for their chicken, all sauces should be readily available for their sausages!  I think the limitation slightly bothers me.  Despite that, Wurstkuche is delicious!  I'll definitely be back again!"

I've been here a couple of times and have found that despite my lack of love for sausages, I cannot help but love the food here. I'm not much of an exotic eater so I've tried the more normal tasting sausages such as the mango and jalapeno ( which is really good a bit spicy and sweet) the chicken and apple sausage which is so good and you get two, and the sun dried tomato and mozzarella which is just quite yummy and cheesy. I don't really like salty sausages so all the ones I've mentioned are more of the sweet tasting one. You also get a choice of sweet peppers, spicy peppers, onions, and saurekrat. The fries are so so good they are crispy and with the variety of sauce you can't go wrong. I usually go for the chipotle ketchup for a little kick. The atmosphere is pretty chill you go order and then take a number and go sit down. Most of the time there is a line but it's not too bad. It's also pretty nice to sit outside during cool nights. Inside the seating has a bunch of long bench tables so it's good for large groups. If you have a huge appetite I recommend you getting two orders of sausages just because the portions are not that large. This is definitely a place if you want to try a variety of different sausages and yummy german fries :D"

Sadly, alligator and pork is no longer an option, but it won't take away from me being a patron. Buffalo, beef, and pork is also a good choice. Duck & bacon is great too! Beers are awesome. From Aventius to St. BERNARDUS. Special thanks to Paulina and Mark, for making us feel at home, every time we go. Great customer service, as they provided me with a side of peppers for my food, upon request. Most definitely need to come back soon. Please Wurstkuche, bring alligator back! I miss it. Lol"

We waited in line for about 20-30 minutes. They even gave us samples while we waited in line and they let you order your beer while waiting too so that's a plus!Everything on the menu sounded so good, but I opted for the duck, bacon, and jalapeno dog with caramelized onions. I also got a large order of fries with pesto mayo and chipotle aioli sauce. They give you a number and then bring your order to you. I love the vibe of the place...its a pretty dark room with a dj and a bar. Definitely a fun atmosphere. The dog was a good size; not too big and not too small. It was enough for me. The caramelized onions on my dog was delicious. The fries there are addicting!!!! I wanted more after I finished it.They were super fresh. I loved the dipping sauces that I got with it as well and even used the sauces for my hot dog! Overall, the dog was good, but the fries were the highlight of my meal! I will definitely be back!

I love having the sauces layered on top of the fries so that it kind of blends in all together but they don't do that here :( The fries weren't really fresh-off-the-fryer hot and the truffle oil made it a little bit too salty, but they were absolutely delicious. The sauces made the fries even better, although I can't say which sauce was better because I double dipped the sauces together (which made it taste great).yelp.com/user_local_phot…I also tried the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage with caramelized onions and spicy peppers. The sausage so juicy and flavorful and the caramelized onions and spicy peppers added even more taste to it.

A fellow yelper suggested that I try Wurstkuche if I was ever in the LA area, so I figured why not, sausages are always a pretty good way to go. My friends and I got there around 10pm after the Clippers/Warriors game and the line was out the door (definitely expected, have you seen how many reviews this place has?!). I was feeling adventurous so I decided to give the Rattlesnake Rabbit Sausage a try, this was the most amazing combination ever!! So juicy, savory, and spicy all in a plump sausage neatly nestled in a toasted fluffy house-made bun. I topped it off with grilled onions, sauerkraut, and dijon mustard.  I was super hungry but I knew if I scarfed down my sausage I would be extremely disappointed in myself for not savoring every bite. I also got a chance to try the St. Bernardis Beer - 100pt beer, so flavorful and refreshing, I couldn't believe that it was 10%! This place is a little pricey for sausages but the atmosphere and food really makes up for it. Pretty trendy spot in the art district of downtown LA, I absolutely loved my experience here."

I have yet to try all the menu items, let alone the exotic meats, but they have all been delicious. Burst of oils and juices are expected with each bite. The fries are really soft and crispy on the outside and are paired nicely with two sauces of your choice. This place offers a wide selection of beers, and I really admire the effort in using the properly shaped glasses that are used to accentuate each.  Lunch time seems to be the better time to come here since it's much quieter and easier to find a place to sit.

Choice of MUSTARD: They have a selection of mustards and you get to choose one, I usually go with spicy brown or yellow mustard. IF you don't want mustard they also have ketchup.SAUSAGES:So many to choose from! and they have some weird ones like rattlesnake and rabbit meat sausage. That is just too exotic for me. So far I've tried Mango Jalapeno, Lousiana Hot link, and Kielbasa. They were all excellent! The mango one is slightly sweeter which i loved :) They were all cooked to perfection and they taste amazing. AHH SO GOOD! I definitely want to try more. So far the mango jalapeno is my favorite!You can also get belgian fries! And you should :D Their fries are crunchy and their dipping sauces are great! I love their chipotle aioli sauce, it is amazing with their fries.They have so many choice dipping sauce and i just want to try them all! You could also get it plain with just truffle oil if that's your thing :) The beer selection here is also pretty big and it's the perfect pairing for their sausages! The place does get pretty packed and their could be a wait. The ambiance is super casual and their dining area was similar to a school cafeteria with long wooden tables separated by napkin holders. The service was pretty good and I would come back just to try all their sausage flavors!"

It was basically a glorified hot dog with a German twist, I guess? Wouldn't know too much about German cuisine considering I've never been. But, all in all, I was happy! Casual and laid back without any hipster pretentiousness! Always have a good time when I'm in the Arts District!"

My friend finds Wurstkuche via her yelp app and eyes the apple pie ice cream sandwich. We map it. It's within walking distance. And we're off on an adventure!We followed the gray brick road and the walk alone there was worth it. We're huge street art fans and we clicked away taking pictures left and right as Wurstkuche is in the Arts District. Can't get any better than this for is.Wurstkuche is slightly hidden, even the entrance is a tad misleading. It's almost like you walk into the rear of it (maybe we did?).  No one greeted us. Granted I'm not expecting a red carpet treatment, I just wanted a smile and a hello. Instead we got confused looks (maybe because my 9 year old son was with us...bringing a 9 year old into a beerfest restaurant?).  We ordered our dessert, paid the $5 plus for it, and entered the eating area. It's Hipster Central. Everyone was eating sausage of some kind.  I didn't mind it, but I knew I wasn't going to eat there.Ice cream sandwich was yummy. Seating area was cool.  If you want to impress a date or a friend with this out of the way hipster joint, you just might. The walk around that neighborhood is more impressive though :)"

        "review": "So over the past weekend, I ended up eating rattlesnake...and it was quite underwhelming, to say the least. I heard about Wurstkuche through some friends on Facebook and Instagram and was curious after seeing that many sausage concoctions. We arrived around 8PM and found a rather long line extending to the outside of the restaurant. The wait took over half an hour, which was to be expected, judging by the popularity of this place. I decided to go with the Rattlesnake& Rabbit w/Jalapeno Peppers hot dog, topped with sweet peppers and caramelized onions, since the menu described this  sausage as mildly spicy with a buttery taste. I also split a large order of Belgian Fries with truffle oil with the rest of my group. Now I've heard that reptile meat is actually quite mild and a bit reminiscent of chicken, so I wasn't expecting any weird or off-putting tastes. Actually, it just didn't really taste like anything at all. At least not much different from that of any other dirty dog I could get off the streets of LA. The sausage had a bit of a kick to it but the peppers and onions did most of the work on my palate. The Belgian Fries were nothing special either, as we paid an extra $2 for truffle oil, but were asking ourselves, \"Um, where's the truffle?\" Just like any other thicker cut fries, some of the pieces were soft and mushy while others were crunchy. This was a side dish that we could've done without. Located in a quiet yet hipster neighborhood, this place is more about the hype of trying exotic meats. I mean, besides watching Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmerman, where else are you going to get much exposure to eating stuff like crocodile, rattlesnake or buffalo? Come here to try it for the sake of trying it, but don't expect any wild, culinary awakening."

Since it was my first time I wanted to try a \"regular\" cut of meat first before I tried anything exotic. So I tried the bratwurst with sauerkraut and caramelized onions, with the large fries! Accompanied with chipotle aioli, and sun dried tomato basil mayo I wanna say. I didn't care for the sun dried tomato mayo so much, but the chipotle one was pretty tasty. I really liked the huge ass condiment bottles on each table. The honey mustard was really good, I straight up dipped my fries in it. The whole grain mustard was really prominent but the flavor was really good too. But hands down dat honey mustard would taste good on anything. My friend got the kielbasa with sauerkraut and caramelized onions, as well. I felt like a total goober not knowing about the huge patio seating. I had to wait for the a customer to tell me there's more seating in the back. I'm an idiot. But anyway, we finally get our food and everything paired really well together. I wanna go back and try the fancy sausages and not just stick with something so plain. But, the service was very friendly and I like that there is water on hand, and actually in glasses. I kinda just want more of their fries right now with honey mustard, chomp chomp munch munch."

And from the walk, we saw pretty cool graffiti on the wall. There was barely a line so we quickly got to order. I felt in an 'exotic' mood so I ended up getting the rattlesnake and rabbit.VIBE/PLACE:+very minimal style decor+/- the sausages are displayed but don't look too appealing+menu is very straight forward+ there is a hallway to the right of the register. It seems kind of hidden, but you go down the hallway and there's lots of seating (reminded me of a cafeteria kind of haha) and also an outdoor patio as well+sort of had the hipster vibe+met two nice guys and talked about occupyLA with them and the LA scene hahaFOOD/SERVICE:Ordered the RATTLESNAKE & RABBIT because one of the reviews said it was juicy and flavorful+the person I ordered from suggested the two toppings (caramelized onions and sweet peppers) for me and followed his recommendations+it wasn't too busy when we were there during the weekday so it was nice and mellow. Got to collect all the different mustard bottles and put them on our table :P+they bring your order to you and it was really quick.VERDICT:I honestly wouldn't know how rattlesnake/rabbit would taste like so everything here is based on their integrity right haha. Although I didn't have high hopes for the hotdog, I was still a little disappointed because the sausage wasn't as flavorful and juicy as I would like. Basically all I could think of was \"meh, it's ok, but hotdogs really are just hotdogs\"..... except I think dirty, greasy, juicy dogs or hot dog stands outside a club after a night of drinking and dancing are the absolute bests!I would come again to try out other hotdogs though. Their concept is still pretty neat. Also their bar looks awesome and I would like to try out their drafts."

I think they are Tofurky or Field Roast quality.  I had the Italian with sauerkraut and caramelized onions.  Most of the mustards on the tables were too spicy/yucky for me, so I went with plain yellow.  The bread is not the typical soft hot dog bun, but I think that is because some of the combos are heavy and need a stronger bread.The husband got the rattlesnake and rabbit version, and I couldn't help but try a crumb.  It was completely different from anything I've ever tasted... if you're feeling adventurous, go for it!They also have a lot of interesting soft drinks to choose from... cucumber, elderflower, some sort of orange jigger... hmm."

As we entered , there is someone passing out little menus and taking drink orders since there's usually a long line. (FYI we were not greeted and the bf went to the front to get a menu, maybe the guy didn't see us when we walked in??) Once you're drinking your beer in line and place your order, they hand you a red triangle number thing to place on your table to spot you in the eating area in the back. We sat down and were entertained with the different sauces and the the fact that water was so yummy since it had a hint of cucumber. From there we waited ,waited and waited. Let's just say we saw a couple sit, get their food, eat it and left lol. At that point , we were ready to go to the front but one of the waitresses came up to ask about our food and came back to give us free fries because of the wait = we were content . 10 min after that our food arrives and the manager came over and took care of the whole bill and apologized which pretty much left us stunned. In conclusion , the fries are amazing, the food was alright but its all the different options that I think keeps people coming. That's one of the reasons I'm going back but taking care of the bill was so sweet of them and after waiting 45 min , they took care of the situation like superstars.

I was tight on money so I didn't get an exotic dog and went with the gourmet Filipino Maharlika--it was hands down delicious. My friends got the duck and bacon, rattlesnake and rabbit, and crocodile and pork which are all on their exotic menu; all three of those were pretty good too so I don't think you can go wrong with any of the sausages they have here. Read the description on the menu--it helps.Aside from the sausage we also got fries with curry ketchup and pesto mayo. 75 cents each which is a bit pricey but we didn't even use all of it...should have put some on the hotdog. The curry ketchup is alright and the pesto mayo is a must try if you are a pesto lover.You order in the front which is well lit but you eat in the back which is a club-like environment. There are hardly any lights in there but it is manageable. If you want to take a picture for instagram then go to the front where there is light. Not sure if it is like this during the day (probably isn't). There is also loud music playing so you can't really talk to any of your friends.

There's plenty of street parking, so your only worry is if you suck at paralleling. FOOD: I ordered the Duck with ___ (I forget!), large order of belgian fries with pesto mayo and bluecheese bacon walnut (did I mix up the order?). My friend went with a good ol' bratwurst, but both were delicious! The bun was nice and toasted to perfection, and the sweet onions and hot peppers complimented the hotdog very well. I also exercised my 21-ness (YES!) and ordered the Forest Apple Ale. DELICIOUS. It tastes like a grown up's apple cider. Total cost of the meal? ~$19 Not so excited about that, but hey, that's life.ATMOSPHERE: Order first, then wait for your food while you drool staring at other people eat. The place is full of long tables but also has a couple of small tables lining its walls. Great for both large groups and cute hipster dates.SERVICE: Everyone was super nice and attentive, not that they needed to be. Everything is laid out for you (ketchup&mustards).

I was eating veg at the time and tried each of their more popular veg sausages - the Italian vegetarian and the apple sage vegetarian - both were excellent, and this is coming from a most of the time carnivore who likes really good sausages. From a flavor standpoint, they tasted like authentic meat sausages, which is unprecedented in my book. I did sweet peppers and caramelized onions on both and loved the combination. I will definitely be back to try all of the unique fare including the rabbit, rattlesnake, and the alligator if it gets put back on the menu (it was out at the time of my visit).The truffle fries were also exceptional, and pair perfectly with the curry catsup, which was the most unique and delicious take on catsup in recent memory. Round this out with a wide selection of craft beers, and we've got a winner. 1 star off for price, as I paid nearly 30 dollars for 2 dogs, small fries and a beer. Valet was $5, so that puts my meal into the mid $30 range.Honestly though, I can't blame them for charging what they charge - they can barely fight the demand off as it is, they deserve to be successful."

        "review": "The latest dining experience at Wurstkuche fell pretty far from the level of excellence that I usually enjoy here.Thought this would be a nice place to start a double date in the arts district the other night...what could go wrong for a group of four friends expecting to enjoy great beer, craft sausage, and truffle fries with usually amazing sauces, right?Unfortunately, the food really fell short. Here was our order (and, please note, this order is usually EPIC, hence why we always order this):1. Bockwurst with caramelized onions and hot peppers= on this one, the bock was on point, but someone must have neglected the onions because they came out blackened (in the worst way possible). Had to wash the taste of burn away with a fair amount of Franziskaner, then scrape away the toppings, which essentially left a plain jane bock, which isn't as enjoyable.2. Mango Jalapeno with sweet and spicy peppers= luckilly we avoided the onion debacle on this one, but the sausage tasted undercooked or something, as the turkey and chicken inside seemed almost raw toward the center of the dog. This one was mine, so I made the judgment call to eat it, despite recommendations to send it back. 3. Duck & Bacon with caramelized onions and sauerkraut= onions were an issue here, so ditto to the explanation above, except substitute the Franz with the Berliner Weisse.4. Vegetarian dog with sweet and spicy peppers= not a problem with this one. Also ordered two large orders of truffle fries. Fries came burnt, and with wrong sauces. We had to send that back, and thought they would send new fries out right away...wrong. 30 minutes later, as we had been long done with the sausage situation and our beers empty, lo and behold came the fries.We'd paid for em so we took em to go, but the moment had truly passed.Hoping this was a fluke, but hopefully this gets resolved."

No matter what sausage and toppings you choose, you have to get the fries. They are delicious and hard to stop eating. They have a number of dips for the fries, though I always get the aioli. I'm drooling just thinking of it. In the back, there's a lot of communal seating and a huge bar. They have got a ton of beers on tap and they are glad to serve you samples if you ask. Try to go on an off-hour if you come with a group. It gets very packed with the downtown lunch crowd and around 7pm. Also, street parking can be tight."

Haven't tried any of the exotic sausages, but of the sausages I've tried, I recommend the following: Austin Blues, Bratwurst, Chicken and Apple, Filipino Maharlika, and Louisiana Hot Link. The only one I wouldn't recommend is the Bockwurst, because it's kinda bland and has an off-putting grainy texture, reminiscent of Oscar Meyer bologna.My favorite toppings are the caramelized onions and the sweet peppers, because they're flavorful, yet don't overpower the taste of the meat. Big selection of mustards. The whole grain, Dijon, and spicy brown are my favorites. The honey mustard has a funky taste to it...The fries and dipping sauces are fantastic! I didn't think I'd like the bleu cheese/bacon/walnut dip, but it is very tasty. My other favorite dips are the chipotle aioli and the curry ketchup. The only dip I disliked was the Thai peanut--I normally love Thai peanut sauce, but the ginger is way too overpowering in this one!Huge variety of beers and fancy sodas. If you want beer, I recommend the Franziskaner, Weihenstephaner Dunkel, or any of the Chimays. For soda, try the spiced apple cider. It tastes like apple pie filling, but isn't grossly sweet at all."

Of course, it's easier to come when it's not peak hours, but despite the crowds at those hangry hours, I've been consistently impressed by the personable beverage service while in line. It makes the experience that much more enjoyable, and make the line out the door not seem so bad. Also, they're quite understanding of beer mishaps. I once had one of their plastic labels on their 5+ kinds of condiments fall into my beer glass, and they were more than happy to replace my entire glass no questions asked. That gets a gold star in my book. The only minor complaint I have about the place is the lack of seating and loudness, but of course, going at off hours makes it less of an issue. The long tables get crowded very quickly and you'll often find yourself in the company of strangers or squeezed at the end of the bench seat between tables or you'll have to wait a while for a free table, but I like the cozy atmosphere. I'd come here more often if I didn't need to watch my waistline!"

A wide variety of sausages to try from, a fine selection of Beer, great service, a truly intimate Pub for friends and dates to enjoy, with the potential to get very loud and rowdy.I only been once and I ordered the \"Hot Italian\" & the \"Rattlesnake and Rabbit Jalapeño Peppers\" sausage. If I could have had a bite of every sausage, I would do it but my belly could only fit 2 on that particular day. I liked the Hot Italian a lot more as it was juicier/fattier but it was interesting to try the Snake & Rabbit combo. I don't remember what beer I got, but you can leave it up to the bartender to select a brew to your taste as you describe to them. You can taste it before ordering, and at a reasonable price. There are also bars within walking distance so it's safe to know you can have a full night out there.I recommend this to any lovers of sausages, beers, a fun experience and a place to take friends from out of town!"

Also ordered fries with it, and I had a Chimay. Sausage just goes so well with beer! Especially bold beer like Chimay. It was very dark inside, and since it was packed, it was hard to find a seat.

But you'll need something to wash that german down. Now for dessert. Ahh I just want to try everything!After you order you take your number and go down a hallway that leads to a large dining hall with a bar! The lighting is very moody, kind of dim and romantic. They have individual tables or picnic tables all wrapped with butcher paper, and surprisingly clean! I was quite surprised with the environment and the food.THE POISON:Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers topped with sweet peppers and caramelized onions.Rabbit, Veal and Pork Seasoned with White Wine topped with caramelized onions and sauerkraut.Side of groot (large) Belgian Fries with pesto mayo and sweet and sassy BBQ dipping sauce.Downed with Fruli (witbier fermented with strawberry 4.1% ABV).THE VERDICT:It was so delicious I am at a loss for words... I might be over exaggerating but it's how I feel!

I think the atmosphere is what made this restaurant 4 stars and worthwhile. It's very suitable for younger people trying to get together with friends. The food was decent. There was a variety of sausages along with exotic meat. The fries were thick cut and came with a variety of dipping sauces (thai peanut, curry ketchup, etc). There were also mustard squirt bottles on the table for the sausages. For me, the experience was enjoyable because I was having a good night in general. I also got the Mr. Q-Cucumber soda which I enjoyed and everyone was screaming across the table to be heard. It was funny for me.

During the drive to Wurstkuche... I had extremely low, bottom of the barrel expectations of this place. The place is located in the arts district of downtown LA so it's a pretty hipster joint. The staff working there was super laid-back and there wasn't much of a line (at least when I went). I spent some time reading through the different sausages they had and it was all pretty interesting. The sausages range from classics ($5.75), gourmet ($6.50), to exotic ($7.50).  The exotic ones were toOOoo exotic for my liking... buffalo? alligator? rattlesnake? rabbit? All I could think was... ewwwwWww and wWHHAAAAaaa so I ended up ordering the chicken apple & spices with caramelized onions (a super safe choice and something I would recommend to first-timers) and belgian fries with sundried tomato mayo. Seating wasn't too bad, but I can imagine how irritating it could be if there was a long wait. Music was loud, lights were dim, and there were tons of people talking. I left Wurstkuche satisfied with the food and the experience as a whole. I recommend this place to everyone and anyone... hotdog lovers and haters alike!"

It already had a line and I was kind of bummed out but we stayed. We received a menu from this british employee. The prices were sort of high for a \"hot dog\". I got a beer and it was malty and delicious. So we ordered and the wait was not long. I ordered under the Exotic Section of the menu and got the lamb, rattlesnake and the duck. They were all delicious with Spicy pepers and carmelized onions. We also got the large fries but it wasn't even that big. They were big fries but not a big portion. They were delicious with the big selection of unique dipping sauces.Conclusion:Yes I would recommend anyone to come here. It was a great experience. Bring hella money lmao get two wursts hahaha."

This incredibly cool restaurant/lounge is the bee's knees.  Nestled just beyond Little Tokyo on 3rd and Traction (plus a newer location in Venice), the menu boasts an impressive list of gourmet sausages and hot dogs.  From rabbit to rattlesnake, duck to sweet pork, this place is the place for a casual dinner with the girls or a laid-back date with your guy. What's more, not only does the place have crazy good food, it also has an insane selection of beers. From the German Reissdorf Kolsch to my personal favorite, the Früli, an amazingly sweet strawberry beer, Würstkuche is one of those downtown gems that you'll certainly thank me for turning you onto.Insider Tip -  Not a meat lover? Würstkuche is still your place as it offers vegan options such as the Vegatarian Smoked Apple Sage. A tasty combination of apples, Yukon gold potatoes, and rubbed sage, it's absolutely delish."

Things i tried: Belgian Fries Mango Jalopeno Hot Dog w carmelized onions and spicy peppersDuck Hot dogFranziskaner BeerFries: crispy and fried to perfection. Very addicting with the chipotle sauce. Mango Jalopeno Hot Dog: Most juicyest and tastiest hot dog ive ever tried! Duck Hot Dog: This was alright to me. The mango jalopeno hot dog was better Franziskner Beer: Tastes like Heffenwizen but a lot better.Does not need any oranges and does not have any bitter taste to it. This beer is a must have!Entrance: Long line, but goes by quick. Great service w workers asking if we need help with the menu. Looks like a small hole in the wall but when you walk in there is a long hallway that leads you to another seating. Live DJ with GREAT music, very hip and kind of reminds you of a cafeteria but instead a modern one. Very Dark, may need some more lighting. Self serve water. Another bar inside. Very fun and live atmosphere.Overall Experience: GREAT! This place is way better then Pink's Hot Dog. Everyone who goes to LA should definitely try to place! 5 stars all the way!"

        "review": "The popularity of Wurstkuche's sausages is one of it's main drawbacks. We waited in line 45 minutes on a Thursday night to place are order. There a slight reward is your position in line moves from outdoors to indoors as on that threshold you're allowed to order and enjoy a beer. Come with friends to enjoy your time in line.You CAN skip the line for sausages and other food and head directly into the bar or outdoor patio if you're simply drinking. Another tactic to deal with the line for famed sausages is to send the bulk of your group into the bar and rely on 2 volunteers to wait out the line for sausages.IMHO the DJ needs to pump down the volume to promote conversations amongst friends seated at thee table.Yes, with all those airings of grievances Wirstkuche comes through with a five star rating.The reason is you am not easily find their gourmet or exotic sausages elsewhere. My family enjoyed the following:* Alligator and Andouille* Rabbit and Rattlesnake with jalapeño* Duck and baconAll excellent and exotic. My favorite was the Rabbit and Rattlesnake.Erin called the fries the best she's everhad. Amply wedged from potatoes and twice fries - be sure to select most tempting dipping sauces when you order.The beer list of Belgium and German draught and bottled beers numbers in the dozens."

        "review": "Wurstkuche is no normal place to get classic German sausages. Skip the temptation and go for the gold: exotics. This is one place where trying rattlesnake, crocodile, and rabbit wont get you regretting it. You may get funny reactions from your mother who heard you tried it (she asked if I was eating animals at the zoo--silly mom), but it's definitely an adventure worth taking. Food: - Rattlesnake & Rabbit ($8): Definitely dont taste the rattlesnake or rabbit, but you know in your mind that it's in there...somewhere. This was actually a fantastic choice. The sausage is plump and juicy with a mixture of jalapeno peppers which gives it a light and buttery feel with the whole dog. It was the best out of the ones we tried. Definitely recommended if you want to really spook your brain but realize it's not bad at all.  - Crocodile & Pork ($8): This sausage is a bit longer in length from the others, but honestly it's a bit drier. The thicker casing gives it a nice resistance to each bite, but it also doesnt make it as juicy since the dog itself was missing some flavors you would hope to have. Like the other exotics, you cant taste anything funky. I probably wont get this again because of the lack of intriguing texture and flavor that I was hoping for. - Austin Blues ($6.5): We chose this because my brother and I were from Austin, so I guess it kind of worked well. I loved the smokey taste to the dog that encapsulated the pork that it was made of. The slight spiciness was not that distinct, but it did bring a hot texture that made it enjoyable. Flavors were flowing and definitely not dry. It was great but not a top choice for me. It was, for a lack of better words, safe. - Fries with Truffle Oil: Honestly if you havent tried their normal fries, there's nothing to compare this with. It did have a slight hint of the oil but honestly it wasnt anything in specific. They were large-cut fries with a generous flow of cooking oil. Nothing impressive but it did go very well with the dogs.Pros: - Gastropub feel and noise level. Definitely gives that kind of ambiance - Clean and efficient service even though it takes a while to get through the line! - Location is in a bit of a hipster-progressive neighborhood. You can totally feel it.Cons: - A little bit expensive for my taste. $8 for a dog is not my ideal price range, but it was great for what it was. - The lines can be insanely long. like looping around outside. Be careful. I suggest calling before you head over (which really did help) - Parking is tricky since there's no designated parking spot. Finding a spot on the street may be a little tricky.The nonadventurous side of me had its quota-fill for the month. No more crazy foods for a little while, but definitely it was an experience worth documenting. And it's worth coming back to...I'll be back!"

To quote mein friend, zees sausages \"quite frankly, brät us pure joy.\" Now before we get into a swordfight over which sausage brät it's a-game to my mouth, I *must* disclaim that I will be updating this review every time I visit. It's obvious this guy can handle only so much of a sausagefest before tapping out, so I'll be going to take them on, one at a time. I'm not leaving LA anytime soon and we all know Wurstküche AINT never going out of bitness anytime soon, neithers!Upon my first visit to Wurstküche, I was overWelmed by the sheer variety they offer. It was a meat market in there! I'm surprised they didn't have someone working the mop and bucket, cleaning up everyone's drool. Yes there is a line. Don't be a dick and cut! Wait your turn and you will be rewarded with glorious meat tubes. The cashier and the beer lady were extremely pleasant and I like that about places like this. There are no pretentious asswipes here. Even the runner/buss boy gave a me wink when he handed us our food! Hay! Good tip for all of y'all! Although everyone fawns over the Rattlesnake, Rabbit, and chipotle link, I wasn't going to bend over backwards to get it...I was going to let my instinct decide what I was going to have...in general, I need to let my gut decide what it wants me to do every time. It has never been wrong and I need to believe in it more and you do too! Stop being a wiener and believe in yourself...it'll do you some good. Anyway, it decided that pheasant and herbs de provence was what it wanted...topped with caramelized onions and sweet peppers no less. WHOOOOO-WEEEEE! Am I a phucking phan oph the pheasant dog.I bit that brät and honest to God, it bit me back with an explosion of flavor. This tubesteak was absolutely the best cylindrical item i've tasted to date. Fennel and thyme are superb herbs and compliment pheasant meat (which is similar to chicken and possibly turkey). It also paired VERY WELL with my Reissdorf Kölsch draught. Light. Crisp. Excellent with any of the other \"white meat\" sausages. (My friend and I pointed out the veal sausage and how it was like the albino brät. It just stood out among the rest with its pale (lack of) color. o__o) In addition, my friend and I split a \"Groot\" cone of the twice fried Belgian Frites and two dipping sauces...the Chipotle aïoli and the BBQ. Both are amazing..In fact, I would even suggest ordering an extra of the BBQ to go with the Austin Blues brät. These fries were down right delicious and worth every sinful calorie. I don't care what you say, these are MANDATORY.Sigh, until we meet again Wurstküche...I will be dreaming of your meatpoles...every...day...and...night."

The atmosphere is great and friendly and the food is pretty good.When we went inside, we basically ordered what we wanted at the front cashier. Then we took our sign to the back of the restaurant and sat down in those long long tables. So in a way, it's not like, you sit down and wait for your waiter to take your order.... it's more like fast food etiquette but classier. The restaurant itself was pretty modern and hip, and I liked the idea of the long tables. It seemed like a nice place to talk with people sitting nearby you. Also there are small tables, but those are very limited and most likely already been taken, and there is also a nice bar. You also can get your ice cold water, self serve... and also pick up your utensils and napkins next to the water jug.The food... I got a Louisiana hot link with carmelized onions and sweet peppers. Also got belgian fries with pesto mayo, and I also got a Fruili Beer (beer fermented with strawberries). Overall the food was really good. I was more surprised on how good my pesto mayo tasted... that was bomb. Also the sausage was really well made as well as the belgian fries. The fruili beer was good... but $8 for such a little amount... uhh....Overall, my experience was pretty good and I will definitely come here again."

Seating is not assigned.  They have adopted the \"go to a bench and eat\" mentality like at Oktoberfest or lunchtime in grade school.  When it's busy, this can be troublesome.  I suggest sending a friend to find a table while you wait in line if the place is pretty happening. Your sausage is served with the choice of two of the four options:Caramelized Onions: They are good.  I ask them to go light on the onions as they can be a bit overbearing.Sauerkraut: Bring it!  I love this stuff.  How can you not have sauerkraut on your bratwurst?Sweet Peppers: not a fanSpicy Peppers: not a fan, but better than the sweet peppersTheir gourmet mustards are also great: Whole Grain, Spicy Brown, Honey Mustard, and American Yellow.Bratwurst: fine cuts of pork, coriander and nutmeg.  Really good.Filipino Marharlika: sweet prok, natural seasonings.  When I read this I was thinking longanisa, but it's not.  But still really good.Rabbit, veal and pork seasoned with white wine:  like the description, it's light and delicate.  They forgot to mention DELICIOUS!Their Fries are good too.  It's really good with their buttermilk ranch.  I don't really care for their other sauces especially their ketchups, but the tzatzik is new and looks enticing.If you want to try the a German Pilsner: Spaten is light and is really good with bratwurst.Enjoy!"

Enjoy.This is now one of my favorite spots to take out of town clients for a fun lunch!Thanks for making this place so rad."

        "review": "I've been here twice and tried their \"exotic\" sausages. I tried their rattlesnake and alligator sausages and they were very flavorful! The alligator was a bit chewier than the rattlesnake but it didn't stop me from finishing it. And the atmosphere of the place was very hip and cool. Plus, I love that their water in the back has a hint of cucumber in the taste!"

        "review": "Es good! Large selection of german beer. The sausages are yummy and you have a lot of sauce choices for fries. Only two complaint are 1.) that its always packed and can be hard to find a seat if you're with a large crowd. 2) people who leave their mess when they leave. It's hard enough getting a seat then you have to wait for a busser to come and take some slobs trash. Overall, food is good and goes down great with a nice refreshing beer."

        "review": "It's rare to find a restaurant that has as a sausage selection as diverse as their beer selection, but Wurstküche delivers on both fronts. Once you've managed to find parking, have located the correct entrance, navigated yourself to the back of the line, and sent a scout ahead to the dining room to stake out your spot (seriously, do all these things), it's difficult to make a bad choice.Of their many sausages, I've tried several:Bratwurst: Sweet, mild, subtly spicy, and very user-friendly.Hot Italian: Snappy casing, hot and juicy, everything Johnsonville would want it to be.Austin Blues: Perfect southern smoked pork sausage, with just enough heat. I actually don't think it's as spicy as the Italian, but I've never had them at the same time.Marharlika: Such a lovely combination of super-sweet pork, mild spices, super-juiciness. Almost like a high-quality Lil' Smokie. Delightful.Alligator Andouille: Good flavor, but pretty dry and crumbly and a very thick casing. Definitely get with toppings or some sort of accompanying condiment or sauce.Duck and Bacon: I didn't know what to expect with this one, but it was also slightly crumbly in texture. Relatively mild in flavor, I don't think I would have identified either duck or bacon, but it was still quite good.All of their sausages are grilled to perfection and placed lovingly upon a likewise grilled, soft bun that will both yield willingly to your teeth and hold all that shit together. I don't personally get toppings, but they offer grilled peppers, onions, and kraut. In the dining room are bottles of ketchup and all four of the major mustard groups (yellow, dijon, whole grain, something else -- mustard is not my condiment). I also encourage you to experiment with their many sauce offerings such as curry ketchup and blue cheese bacon walnut.I also hope you're a fries person, and even if you are not (and I'm actually not!), you have to try them. These are the best fries in LA -- thick-cut, perfectly fried, slightly crispy, tender, and not too greasy. You can easily share small fries between two people, so I recommend doing so and trying as many sauces as possible alongside.Lastly, if you're into beer, Wurstküche offers a stunning selection of German and Belgian beers both on tap and in bottles, including La Chouffe, Blanche de Bruxelles, and pints (!) of Spaten.Before Wurstküche, I wasn't really the sort of person who would recommend going to a restaurant that exclusively serves sausage, fries and beer. Now, I can't really imagine the Arts District, or my life, without it."

The mango jalapeno is so juicy and while some may shy away from the size it is really filling! You get like 6 kinds of mustard! 6! Whats not to like?"
